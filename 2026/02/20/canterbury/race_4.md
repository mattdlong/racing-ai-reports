## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Golden Loom produced 92.97s winning Canterbury 1550m on soft - the standout figure at this track and distance. No other runner has comparable C/D time data.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No dominant leader identified - Golden Loom and Throttle Response likely to sit midfield. Small field should produce honest tempo without extremes.
**Class**: BM72 is a step up for most runners. Throttle Response (BM64 last) and Le Troisir (CL1) are rising in class. El Paso won CL1 at 1500m and placed in BM72 at Canterbury - has graded form.
**Bias**: Neutral. No significant track bias detected at Canterbury on Good 4. Rail position unknown. Rain forecast may shift conditions toward soft during the evening.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Golden Loom** is the only horse with proven Canterbury 1550m form - a win (92.97s) and a close 2nd (beaten 1.69L) at the C/D in the last two starts. The Ryan-Alexiou yard has him peaking third-up from a spell with Tom Sherry aboard. Barrier 2 gives a tactical advantage in the small field. At $4.40 with a 24% assessed win probability, there's marginal value (+5.6%), but the EW proposition is strong with 67% place probability and a 14.8% combined EW EV.

**El Paso** at $8.50 is the EW value play. Won at 1500m (Kembla Grange CL1), placed at Canterbury 1900m BM72, and the Hawkes stable bringing him back fresh after 62 days off with a barrier trial under the belt. The +19.0% edge is the strongest in the race (confidence interval +7% to +31%), qualifying via Path A for EW value (odds >= $6, EW EV 17%, place prob 40%). The risk is the layoff and the step straight into BM72.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain may deteriorate track to soft - Golden Loom is 0/5 on soft (1 place from 5), which would flip the picture entirely
2. El Paso 62 days off, only a 1030m trial - fitness query at 1550m second-up
3. Le Troisir (market fav at $4.20) has Rawiller and Waller combination with 75% place rate from 4 starts - could outperform on raw ability despite no C/D form
