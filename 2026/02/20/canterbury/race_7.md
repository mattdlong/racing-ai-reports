## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Ferinzo has posted the best raw times at shorter trips (62.89s/1100m Gosford), but untested at 1250m. Albany Road's Canterbury 1100m win (63.91s) and Kensington 1100m win (63.53s) show solid figures with upside as distance extends.

**Pace**: MODERATE - small field, Ferinzo and Albany Road likely to sit handy. No genuine speed-on, which should produce a genuine tempo without extremes. Suits on-pace runners.

**Class**: Ferinzo rising sharply from CL1/provincial to metro BM74 - significant test. Albany Road stepping up from BM72 win, more logical progression. Calga Power also rising from lower grades. Ornithology making debut at this level after only 2 career starts.

**Bias**: Neutral at Canterbury (low confidence). Good 4 with rain forecast - monitor for track deterioration which would suit Albany Road (1:1 soft) and Ferinzo (1:1 soft).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Albany Road is the each-way play at $4.40. The 3yo has won 3 of 6 starts including a Canterbury victory last start (BM72, beating Agarwood who was $2.80 fav). The step to BM74 over 1250m is a logical progression after a strong 1100m campaign. Regan Bayliss retains the ride for the Waterhouse/Bott stable and the EW expected value of +10.4% makes this the clear value angle. Ferinzo is the likely winner but $2.80 offers no value for a horse untested at 1250m and making a sharp class rise from provincial company.

## KEY RISKS

1. Albany Road untested beyond 1175m - the 1250m is a query, though breeding and racing style suggest he'll handle it
2. Ferinzo may simply be too good if the distance is no issue - progressive type with 3 straight wins
3. Rain could deteriorate track further; currently Good 4 with rain falling
