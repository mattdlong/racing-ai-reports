## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Ivan's Hero posted 92.63s winning Canterbury 1550m on Good 3 weeks ago - best recent time in field at this course/distance.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. No confirmed leaders; Ivan's Hero and No Drama likely to stalk. Suits mid-runners.
**Class**: Ivan's Hero rising from BM72 to BM78 but on a 3-win streak (BM72 > BM64 > BM72). No Drama also BM78 level but inconsistent form pattern.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Good 4 track with rain - may deteriorate. Ivan's Hero 5/25 on Good (solid), No Drama 3/13 on Good.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Ivan's Hero is the clear form horse with a sensational 3-1-1-2-1 last 5 runs including a Canterbury 1550m win 3 weeks ago in 92.63s. Trained by Chris Waller and proven at the course (1/5) and distance (3/16). The class rise from BM72 to BM78 is the key question, but the winning form suggests he's above BM72 level. At $3.70 he offers +11% edge against an estimated 30% win probability - fair odds $3.33. The apprentice claim (Siena Grima) offsets the weight rise. Only genuine value play in the race.

No Drama ($2.70 favourite) looks short given a 7th last start at Rosehill 1350m and inconsistent form pattern (2-3-9-x-1-7). Has Canterbury 1550m placings but not at this price. Art Volant ($3.40) has been racing at shorter distances (1200m) and has poor recent form (x-9-8-5-5) - no appeal stepping up to 1550m first time.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise BM72 to BM78 - first start at this level since Apr 2025
2. Barrier 7 of 7 runners - widest draw, though field size mitigates this
3. Apprentice jockey Siena Grima - claim helps weight but less experience

## GREEN LIGHTS

1. Won this course/distance 3 weeks ago (Canterbury 1550m Good)
2. Outstanding form cycle: 3-1-1-2-1 last 5 starts
3. Chris Waller stable in strong form
4. Good track record (5/25 wins on Good)
