## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Hay Street holds the best figures (80), 5pts clear of Rach (75). Eynesbury improving (68) with scope for more.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No confirmed leaders; Hay Street and Nordic Viking likely to be prominent. Should suit on-pace runners.
**Class**: All maidens stepping into CL1 for the first time. Hay Street contested Vain Stakes (Listed) as a 2yo - clear class edge. Nordic Viking has most race experience (8 starts).
**Bias**: No significant bias detected. Rail position not specified. LOW confidence in bias data.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Eynesbury offers the only genuine value play at $11. Second at Gosford (beaten 0.13L) last start in a maiden represents solid form for this CL1 field. Nash Rawiller takes the ride for Chris Waller, a powerful combination. The inside barrier (3) is advantageous, and the gelding is improving with racing. At double-figure odds, the each-way return is attractive with EW EV of +8.7% confirmed.

Hay Street is clearly the most talented runner (best speed figures, Listed class experience) but is significantly overbacked at $2.50 against our 28% win probability - a 25% underlay. The market is pricing in his trial win and class edge but ignoring that he's never won a race start.

## KEY RISKS

1. Eynesbury's inconsistent form (9th two starts back) and limited race experience (3 starts)
2. Rain forecast could shift track to Soft, altering the going dynamics - Eynesbury untested on heavy
