## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Lugarno ran 0.17L off at Gosford 2100m BM64, best figure at this trip. Goofinator won 3200m BM74 at Wagga and was 0.1L 2nd over 2400m BM66 - superior staying credentials.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Goofinator and Shanoni likely to sit midfield; no clear speed horses. Suits on-pace runners in small field. Goofinator's proven ability to grind out a staying result is an asset.
**Class**: Goofinator drops from BM74 (won) and BM66 (2nd) to BM64 - clear class edge. So Rebellious rises from maiden win at Canterbury 1550m. Shanoni unproven beyond 1550m despite being favourite.
**Bias**: Good 4, neutral bias expected. Rain forecast could soften track - benefits Goofinator (1W/1P from 3 on heavy, 2W/5P from 9 on soft) and would hurt Sir Tua (0/0 from 4 on soft).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Goofinator represents outstanding value at $12.00 in an 8-runner field. He's the only proven stayer in the race, having won over 3200m at BM74 grade (two classes above this) and finishing 0.1L 2nd over 2400m at BM66. The drop to BM64 over 1900m is a significant class relief. Dylan Gibbons retains the ride from barrier 3. His 54% career place rate (13 placings from 24 starts) confirms he's a genuine place specialist (1.41 score). The $12.00 represents a fair odds line of $6.25 - the market is severely underestimating his staying form because his recent 1550m and 1300m runs are not at his best trip. Each-way EV of +74.8% is exceptional.

So Rebellious is a secondary play at $11.00 - won at Canterbury 1550m last start and has course knowledge (3 starts, 1 win). The step to 1900m is a query but he ran 4th over this trip at Canterbury on soft (1.4L off). Marginal EW value at +4.0%.

## KEY RISKS

1. Goofinator's metro form is limited - best recent results at country/provincial tracks (Wagga, Goulburn, Dubbo). Canterbury is a tighter track requiring tactical speed.
2. Rain forecast could shift track to Soft - while Goofinator handles wet, the pace dynamics may change and favour Shanoni who won maiden on Heavy.
3. Shanoni ($3.10) has T Berry/C Waller combination and 6-day backup which signals trainer confidence despite untested at 1900m.
