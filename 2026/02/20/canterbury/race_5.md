## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figures in this field. Miss Capitale's CL2 win time was moderate; Manukau's maiden win at Kembla was solid for the grade.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No confirmed leaders - Burj (bar 2) and Choice Witness (bar 1) likely roll forward. Suits on-pace runners.
**Class**: Manukau (maiden -> BM78) and Miss Capitale (CL2 -> BM78) both making significant class jumps. Thames (73% place rate) and Vanessi (C/D specialist) are class-proven at this level.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Rain forecast may shift conditions - monitor for soft upgrade.

## PLACE SPECIALIST ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Place Rate | Expected | Specialist Score | Rating |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| 9 | Manukau | 83% | 55% | 1.50 | STRONG |
| 3 | Thames | 73% | 41% | 1.79 | STRONG |
| 7 | Vanessi | 57% | 36% | 1.58 | STRONG |

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Manukau is the value play in this race. His 83% place rate (5 from 6 career starts) is extraordinary, and the Tommy Berry booking signals the stable expects a bold performance stepping up from maiden to BM78. While the class jump is significant (fair odds $4.35 vs market $4.00 on win), the EW proposition at +3.1% EV is driven by his exceptional place consistency and 65.2% place probability. The $1.50 place odds provide a 14.1% place EV overlay. At $4.00 with 1/4 place terms, the each-way bet captures value through the place component even if he can't win outright.

Miss Capitale ($3.30 fav) is too short given a wide barrier (12 of 12) and massive class rise from CL2 provincial to BM78 metro. Thames and Vanessi are both strong place specialists but offer no win value at $4.80.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class jump: Manukau won a maiden at Kembla - BM78 metro is a 3+ class rise. Career has been at low levels.
2. Untested at 1100m: All 6 career starts at 800-1300m but never specifically at 1100m. Should handle it.
3. Rain/track deterioration: Manukau has no heavy track form. If upgraded to Soft, his 0/3 win record on soft is concerning (though 2 places from 3).

## GREEN LIGHTS

1. Tommy Berry booking - elite jockey upgrade signals confidence
2. Michael Freedman stable in strong form
3. Barrier 5 ideal in 8-horse field
4. 83% career place rate - exceptional consistency
5. Progressive profile - won maiden last start convincingly

## RED FLAGS

1. Massive class rise (maiden to BM78)
2. No race experience at Canterbury or 1100m specifically
3. Only 6 career starts - small sample size on place consistency
