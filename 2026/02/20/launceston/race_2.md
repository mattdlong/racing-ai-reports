## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Bad Alibi ran 73.37s over 1220m at Launceston on Soft (winning) - best recent time in the field at this track. Ilovethistown ran 71.05s over 1200m winning at Launceston but from a weak maiden field of 7.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected with Ilovethistown and Novalargo likely prominent from inside barriers. Bad Alibi can sit midfield and finish strongly - improving form pattern (8-4-3-2-1) suggests peak fitness.
**Class**: All contenders BM60 grade or rising from maidens/CL1. Bad Alibi steps up from maiden win but 1L margin from 14-runner field was solid. Accusaient won maiden at Hobart by 0.75L - needs to prove at this level.
**Bias**: Neutral bias, low confidence. Soft 5 track with rain - wet trackers preferred. Bad Alibi 1w/3p from 3 soft starts. Accusaient 1w/1p from 5 soft starts.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Bad Alibi** is the primary selection based on peak form trajectory (8-4-3-2-1), Launceston course specialist (5 starts, 1 win, all at this track), and value at $5.50 with 10% edge. The 3yo filly won her maiden impressively last start over 1220m here on Soft, and the step to BM60 is manageable given she beat a field of 14. Strong place specialist score of 1.9 makes her ideal EW at these odds. **Accusaient** qualifies as EW VALUE via Path A - $10.00 odds with 11.7% EW EV and 35% place probability. Won her maiden at Hobart two starts back but untested at Launceston. The 20% win edge at double-digit odds provides excellent value if she handles the track switch. Craig Newitt booking adds confidence.

## KEY RISKS

1. Bad Alibi stepping from maiden to BM60 - class rise untested
2. Barrier 8 in 12-runner field on Soft track may force wide passage
3. Accusaient has no Launceston form - track suitability unknown
4. Ilovethistown ($3.50 fav) has course-distance win and inside draw - market respects this runner heavily
