## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Figures are compressed across the field (77-86 range). No standout - Who Can It Be Now (85.9) and Alpine Trout (85.7) have best raw figures but at prohibitive prices reflecting other weaknesses.
**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected with several on-pace types (Kiss My Rock, Alpine Trout, High Tail Eagle). Mid-runners with good barriers (Snow Eagle bar 5, Gee Gee Can Win bar 4, Sky Eagle bar 6) should get a soft run in transit.
**Class**: BM58 provincial - all runners at similar level. Montezulu drops from BM60, marginal advantage. Kiss My Rock has run in BM56 mainland (slight rise effectively).
**Bias**: Neutral bias confidence LOW. Soft 5 with rain - track likely to deteriorate further. Proven wet trackers (Montezulu 3/14, Rich Clan 3/22, Always A Winner 4/12) have an edge. Gee Gee Can Win (0/12 soft) and Corsa Veloce (0/7 soft) are serious concerns.

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

Snow Eagle (3.76 specialist score) and Rich Clan (3.49) are **strong place specialists** per career stats. However, fixed place odds ($2.38 and $2.80) don't offer sufficient margin given 27% and 27% place probability estimates.

## WATCH LIST

**#4 Montezulu** ($7.50) - Closest to value. Proven soft tracker (3/14), class drop, fresh off a win. Wide barrier (13) is the main concern in an 18-runner field on wet ground. If drifts to $9+, reconsider.

**#14 Sky Eagle** ($9.00) - Ultra-consistent placer (form 4/2/4/2/5), good barrier (6), lightest weight (55.5kg). Soft win rate is poor (1/16) but places often enough. If place odds drift to $3.50+, EW becomes interesting.

## KEY RISKS

1. Soft 5 with ongoing rain - track could deteriorate to Heavy, reshuffling the form entirely
2. 18-runner field with 131.6% market = value is extremely hard to find; overround absorbs any edge
3. Multiple Blacker-trained runners (4 entries) may create pace complications
