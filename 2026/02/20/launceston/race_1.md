# Launceston R1 | 1100m CL3 (Maiden SW)
Fri 20 Feb | 6:08pm | 15r | Soft 5

## ACTION

**NO WIN BET** - No contender meets Best Bet or Strong Value thresholds in this weak maiden.

**EW WATCH: #6 TEAM HEIST @ $9.00 - Place Specialist (score 2.64)**
Qualifies via Path B but long spell (233 days) warrants caution. Monitor for market support pre-race.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No reliable speed figures - maiden field with limited race timing data. Rushonova's two runs at Launceston (2nd, 3rd) are the best form reference.
**Pace**: MODERATE - several first-starters will likely settle back, genuine pace uncertain. Barrier 1 (Awesome Orphan) and barrier 3 (Team Heist) can dictate positions.
**Class**: All runners maiden class (rating 60). Team Heist competed in VIC maidens (Mornington, Sale, Pakenham) which rate higher than TAS maidens - class drop advantage.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Soft 5 track may favour experienced wet-trackers - Rushonova (2 from 2 on soft) and Team Heist (1 place from 2 on soft).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No runner qualifies for a Best Bet or Strong Value selection. **Rushonova** is the clear class runner with 100% placing rate (2 from 2) at this track on soft ground, but $3.00 in a 15-runner maiden with barrier 13 offers no value - fair odds closer to $4.00. **Team Heist** qualifies as an EW Place Specialist (score 2.64) via Path B with consistent placing form (4 placings from 9 starts in stronger VIC maidens), but the 233-day spell is a significant concern and negates a formal recommendation.

## KEY RISKS

1. Large maiden field (15 runners) with 7 debutants - high variance, unpredictable
2. Rushonova drawn barrier 13 in a 15-horse field at 1100m on soft - must overcome traffic
3. Team Heist returning from 233-day spell with no trial evidence at this distance
