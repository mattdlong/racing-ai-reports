## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Magnaprime rates best on estimated figures from 1400m wins (70.76s/1200m at BM68, 85.25s/1400m BM76 win). Perspiration's 71.73s Hobart win is solid. Geegees Gemstone's 71.61s 2nd at this track is competitive but carries 59.5kg.

**Pace**: MODERATE - no confirmed leaders in the field. Geegees Gemstone and Turk Warrior have early speed history. Magnaprime is a stalker who should get a perfect run from barrier 2. Perspiration races on-speed.

**Class**: Magnaprime is rising sharply (CL3 -> BM76) but won BM76 last start at 1400m. Perspiration raced BM78 at Warwick Farm in Sydney (5th, beaten 0.14L) - the class benchmark. Geegees Gemstone is proven at this level. In The Ocean stepping up from CL6.

**Bias**: Good 3 with rain - track may deteriorate. No significant bias detected at Launceston (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. Inside barriers marginally favoured in small fields.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#4 Magnaprime** is the top selection on the progressive form trajectory. Won his last two starts including a BM76 at this track over 1400m, and drops to 1200m with only 54kg. The 4yo is improving rapidly (6 wins from 13 starts, 85% place rate) and gets a perfect barrier 2 draw. Trainer Adam Trinder has this horse in career-best form. The only question is the shorter trip, but his earlier 2nd at 1200m BM68 (beaten 0.25L) suggests the distance is within range.

**#5 In The Ocean** is the each-way play as a strong place specialist (score 1.91). His 80% career place rate is exceptional and he's won 6 from 11 at Launceston. The concern is 0/3 at 1200m - his wins are all at 1100m or shorter. At the right price ($6+), the place component offers value.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Magnaprime untested at 1200m BM76** - his wins have been at 1400m; shorter trip is unproven at this class
2. **Good 3 with rain** - track may shift to Soft; Magnaprime is 0/3 on Good but 5/8 on Soft (actually favours)
3. **No market odds available** - cannot confirm value exists until markets open
4. **Perspiration is the danger** - ex-Sydney, Luke Currie booked, won last start, could be underrated
