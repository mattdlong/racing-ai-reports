## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Johnnie Pinch and Vino Novello rate highest on raw time comparisons at the distance; Zurich's best 2100m figures at Launceston (133.15, 134.37) are competitive.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no dominant leader in this field. Mid-race movers (Johnnie Pinch, Vino Novello) should benefit from a genuine tempo without extreme pressure.
**Class**: Several dropping from BM68/Open class (Johnnie Pinch, Vino Novello, Zurich, Iffycould) - class relief at BM64 level is a significant positive. Spring Bean also drops from BM68.
**Bias**: Good 3 with rain forecast - track may deteriorate. No strong bias detected (LOW confidence). Bias neutral for style and barrier.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Johnnie Pinch** (#2) ranks top on composite scoring. Won at this C/D (2100m Launceston, BM60, 14 Jan) by 2.5L and placed 2nd in Open Hcp at 2150m (30 Jan). Outstanding place consistency (55% career, specialist score 1.74). Barrier 5 ideal in large field. Drops from Open Hcp class. Key concern: only 1 win from 16 Good track starts vs 2 from 10 on Soft - monitor if track stays Good. At $5+ each-way represents the best value proposition in this field.

**Vino Novello** (#4) has the highest career win rate (38%) and won impressively at this exact C/D (2100m BM64 Launceston, 29 Oct) by 1.25L. Exceptional place specialist score (2.13). However, last start 7th of 8 at 2100m BM68 (23 Jan) is a concern - only 27 days between runs. Still just 8 starts so could be improving, but the flop last time can't be ignored.

**Zurich** (#5) is the standout C/D horse - 3 wins from 6 at 2100m, 3 wins from 7 at Launceston course. Won here 23 Jan (BM68, 134.37). But barrier 13 in a 15-horse field is a significant negative, and form is very up-and-down (1-6-2-6-1-8). Needs to produce his A-game.

## KEY RISKS

1. **No market odds available** - all edge/value calculations are estimated. Re-assess when markets open.
2. **Rain forecast** - track rated Good 3 but could deteriorate. Johnnie Pinch (1/16 on Good) and Vino Novello (0/1 Good) both have concerning Good track records; paradoxically they may benefit if it wets up.
3. **Large field (15 runners)** - wide barriers (Zurich 13, Snow Eagle 14, Just A Needs 15) severely disadvantaged over 2100m.

| Vino Novello | $5.50 | BET | EW |
