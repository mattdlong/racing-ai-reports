## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sanniya dominates on raw ability - 6/7 career wins with massive margins (7L, 7.5L wins). Grid Girl won a BM94 at metro Rosehill by the barest margin, the highest-rated recent form in this field.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Stone Cold Stunner and Sanniya likely to press forward. Grid Girl can settle midfield and use her class edge. No genuine speed-on horses to create a truly fast tempo.

**Class**: Grid Girl is the massive class dropper - won BM94 metro Rosehill (rating ~94) now in BM76 provincial TAS (~76). Sanniya has beaten everything in TAS but untested at 1400m and stepping up significantly in distance. Stone Cold Stunner is a genuine C/D specialist (6/13).

**Bias**: Neutral bias, low confidence. Good 3 with rain forecast could deteriorate. Sanniya's soft track form (3/4) is strong. Grid Girl handles all surfaces (wins on good, soft, heavy).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Grid Girl** represents the value play. She won a BM94 at Rosehill Gardens - a metro Saturday race worth significantly more than this $9,616 BM76 provincial event. The Hayes yard sending her to Launceston with Luke Currie aboard signals intent. Her last start 8th at Flemington (Listed Tressady Stakes) is misleading - that was elite company and she was only beaten 1.2L. The wide barrier (12) is the key negative but at 1400m on a big track she can get across. At $6+ she offers genuine value against weaker opposition.

**Sanniya** is clearly the best horse - 86% win rate, dominant margins, and a brilliant talent. However, the 1400m is an untested distance (previous max 1200m), she draws wide (10) in a 13-horse field, and at ~$2.50 there's no edge. She's the likely winner but the price doesn't compensate.

## KEY RISKS

1. Grid Girl barrier 12 in 13-horse field - needs luck from wide gate
2. Sanniya untested at 1400m but has won up to 1200m comfortably - may handle it
3. No fixed odds available yet - estimated odds may shift significantly
4. Rain forecast could change track to soft, potentially helping Sanniya further

## EACH-WAY ASSESSMENT

Grid Girl EW at $6.00: EW EV +2.7% (marginal). Win EV +8.0%, Place EV -2.6%. The win component carries the value - prefer straight WIN bet.

Stone Cold Stunner EW at $8.00: EW EV -10.1% (no value). Strong C/D record but class limited.
