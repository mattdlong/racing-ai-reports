| 7 | Titahi Bay | 5 | 10.00 | 58.54 | POOR | 58 | 0 | Hot | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Snapshot posted 55.48s over 975m at Swan Hill (fastest raw time, albeit short course). No Limitation's 57.34s at Sandown is the best metro-quality figure. Frostnip ran behind a 56.34s winner at Pakenham.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - No Limitation and Snapshot likely to press forward. Only 7 runners reduces pace pressure. Snapshot's on-pace style suits the expected tempo.
**Class**: All runners rising in class to Group 3 level. Snapshot and No Limitation the most progressive. Snapshot unbeaten in 2 starts with decisive margins. Key query is country-to-provincial class jump for Snapshot.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Good 4 with rain - monitor for deterioration. No significant barrier or style bias detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Snapshot represents the best value proposition in this small field. Unbeaten in 2 starts with authoritative wins (2L at Swan Hill, 0.39L at Albury), two strong jumpouts during 114-day break suggest fitness maintained. The $3.70 offers marginal win edge (+3.6%) but strong EW value (+23% EW EV) with 85% place probability. Progressive type from the Craig Weeding stable stepping up in class - the unknown ceiling is the attraction at these odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. 114 days between races - fitness query despite jumpouts
2. Country form only (Swan Hill, Albury) - untested at provincial level
3. Rain may further deteriorate track from Good 4 - no wet form on record

## DANGER

**#1 No Limitation** - Course winner, best metro speed figure (57.34s Sandown), Hayes stable. Erratic form pattern (11th last start at Caulfield 1100m) but drops back to preferred 1000m. WATCH tier at $3.90 - no value against the price.
