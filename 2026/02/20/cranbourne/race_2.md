## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Celsius Star posted the best 1200m time figure (68.78 winner time, 2nd at Flemington BM84). Capper Thirtynine showed solid Moonee Valley/Flemington figures at similar class.
**Pace**: MODERATE - small field with mixed styles. No genuine leader stands out; likely genuine pace without being suicidal. On-pace runners should get their chance.
**Class**: Laa De Sha rising sharply from BM70/78 to BM84. Highland Harley up from BM70. Celsius Star and Capper Thirtynine proven at this level. Lim's Bighorn largely untested at BM84.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Good 4 with rain - monitor for deterioration. Small field reduces barrier impact.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Celsius Star at $6.50 represents strong each-way value in a 5-runner field. He's proven at BM84 level with a strong 2nd at Flemington (68.78s) behind the class runner over 1200m. His 48% career place rate and 60.8% modelled place probability at $2.75 place odds make the each-way proposition compelling (+37.2% EW EV). The market favourite Laa De Sha ($2.35) is unders based on a significant class rise from BM70 to BM84 - fair odds closer to $3.12. Celsius Star is the clear value play.

## KEY RISKS

1. Top weight 62.5kg on a potentially rain-affected surface - heaviest in field by 2kg
2. Inconsistent form pattern (8th, 9th in recent runs) suggests he needs things to go right
3. Rain could upgrade track - Celsius Star has no heavy track form (0 starts)

## EW DETAIL

- Win EV: +30.0% | Place EV: +44.4% | Combined EW EV: +37.2%
- Place prob: 60.8% | Place odds: $2.75
- Path A qualified: Odds $6.50 >= $6, EW EV +37.2% >= +5%, Place prob 61% >= 30%
