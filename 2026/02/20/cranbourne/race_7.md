## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: The Western Front has the best flat speed figures but this is a hurdle race where jumping ability dominates; Sing For Peace and Privileged Son have proven hurdle form at longer trips.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected with no dominant early speed; suits mid-runners and those who settle and jump cleanly through the middle stages.
**Class**: BM120 hurdle is a niche class - several runners stepping up significantly from BM62-70 flat racing; only Sing For Peace (BM120 HDLE) and Privileged Son (BM75 hurdle 2nd) have genuine hurdle class credentials.
**Bias**: No significant track bias detected at Cranbourne tonight (LOW confidence). Neutral rail.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#1 Sing For Peace** is the standout EW value at $17. This 7yo has extensive hurdle experience (6 hurdle starts: 0-2-2-0-1-1 for 33% win, 67% place over jumps), a place specialist score of 3.55, and proven staying ability with 2 wins from 4 starts at 2000m+. The Payne yard are jumps specialists. At $17 with EW EV of +66.3%, this represents strong each-way value in a small field where the market is heavily skewed toward flat-form runners with limited jumps credentials. **#3 Privileged Son** from the same Payne stable offers secondary EW value with a hurdle win at Warrnambool (3172m) and 2nd at Mt Gambier over 3150m. At $17 with +36% EW EV, worth a saver.

## KEY RISKS

1. Sing For Peace's recent flat form is moderate (5th, 6th) and hasn't raced over hurdles since Aug 2025 - fitness for jumping is the key query
2. The Western Front has Craig Williams aboard and dominant flat ability - if the hurdles are straightforward he could win on class alone
3. Powerful Torque is in career-best form (back-to-back wins) and could handle the step up in trip/class

## EW ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Win% | Place% | PlSpec | EW EV | Rating |
|---|-------|------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Sing For Peace | 10% | 32.5% | 3.55 | +66.3% | STRONG EW |
| 3 | Privileged Son | 8% | 25.4% | - | +31.5% | STRONG EW |
| 9 | Thinking Gold | 14% | 40.5% | 2.06 | -0.4% | FAIR |
| 8 | Powerful Torque | 18% | 48.8% | - | -6.2% | NO VALUE |
