## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No meaningful speed figures available - all debutants or one-start maidens with no sectional data. Flash Of Class ran 58.44s at Flemington 1000m (competitive); Simply Steffi ran 58.87s at Caulfield on Soft.
**Pace**: UNKNOWN - insufficient data to model pace shape. Expect a genuinely run 1000m sprint with most runners looking to be prominent.
**Class**: Listed 2YO race. Dance The Boogie is the only runner with a race placing (2nd Bendigo 1000m). Flash Of Class (6th Maribyrnong Trial) and Simply Steffi (7th M Cooper) have metro race experience.
**Bias**: Neutral. No track bias data available for this meeting. LOW confidence.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Dance The Boogie offers each-way value at $13 in a debutant-heavy field where confidence is low across the board. She is the only runner with a race placing (2nd at Bendigo over 1000m on Good), representing genuine race experience in a field of mostly jump-out graduates. The Hayes stable (elite) has prepared her with two recent jump-outs (2nd and 4th) after a 124-day break, suggesting a targeted return. At $13 she qualifies via EW Path A: odds >= $6, EW EV +55.6%, place probability 38.8%. The three short-priced runners (Flash Of Class, Simply Steffi, Dirty Harry) are all underlays on probability assessment - their market prices bake in too much certainty for unraced/lightly-raced 2YOs.

## KEY RISKS

1. **MEDIUM data quality** - almost no race timing data available; probability estimates are low-confidence
2. **124-day break** for Dance The Boogie - fitness question despite recent jump-outs
3. **All debutants carry high variance** - any runner could produce an unexpected performance
4. **Rain forecast** may change track condition during meeting (currently Good 4)

## CAVEATS

Data quality is MEDIUM. This is a 2YO maiden/Listed race where 6 of 8 runners are unraced. Speed figures, pace ratings, and class comparisons are largely unavailable. Probability estimates are primarily driven by trainer quality, jockey bookings, barrier draws, and limited jump-out/trial form. Stake accordingly.
