| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Form | Pace | Class | Bias | Conn | Score | Tier |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|-------|------|
| 1 | Itsukushima | 6 | $2.45 | 22221 | GOOD | 76 | 0% | Hot | 49.1 | WATCH |

| 5 | Phineas | 4 | $2.20 | 6x361 | GOOD | 70 | 0% | Hot | 28.0 | PASS |
| 6 | Super Solar | 1 | $7.00 | 84745 | POOR | 76 | 0% | Neutral | 22.0 | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Itsukushima holds fastest raw 1600m times (96.47s Cranbourne winner), 2s clear of field at this track. Blakmax moderate but consistent mid-pack closer.
**Pace**: MODERATE - small field likely genuine tempo with Itsukushima and Phineas prominent. Suits on-pacers but Blakmax can close into it.
**Class**: Blakmax dropping from BM70 3rd (0.35L off winner) to BM62 - significant class relief. Phineas stepping up from maiden to BM62 first time.
**Bias**: Neutral bias, LOW confidence. No significant track pattern detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Blakmax is the EW play at $10.00 in a 5-runner field. He's a confirmed place specialist (score 1.38, career 58% place rate) dropping from BM70 where he ran 3rd beaten 0.35L at Pakenham. The class drop to BM62 is significant and his 47.8% place probability at these odds yields +52.7% EW EV, qualifying via both Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist). Itsukushima is the most likely winner but $2.45 is too short - fair odds are $3.03, making him an underlay. Phineas at $2.20 is a severe underlay stepping up from maiden class with only 6 starts.

## KEY RISKS

1. Blakmax's last two starts disappointing (7th, 9th) before class drop - may indicate declining form
2. Small 5-runner field compresses place value (only 2 place dividends)
3. Rain forecast could shift track to Soft - Blakmax handles it (3 wins on Soft) but form uncertain
