## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Katsu (82) holds the highest speed figure but hasn't raced competitively since Jun 2025 (250 days). Sparring (80) and Philosopher (78) next best with recent race fitness.
**Pace**: FAST scenario likely - Katsu, Sparring, and Always Enuff are all on-pace types in a small field. Genuine speed contest at 1000m suits those who can sustain early pressure. Sparring's Cranbourne 2nd (0.4L off BM78 winner in 55.23s over 955m) shows sustained speed.
**Class**: Katsu (BM84 class) and Philosopher (BM84/90 level) have the highest class ceilings. Sparring rising from BM78 but won at Open level at Albury/Gundagai. Tookay Pete (BM56-66) and Frose (BM56-66) face a significant class rise.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Rain forecast may shift conditions - Katsu has strong soft form (3/7 wins) while Tookay Pete is poor on wet (0/3).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Sparring at $5.50 EW represents the best value in the race. While Katsu has superior raw ability, his 250-day absence is a major concern - he's unproven returning to race conditions despite winning a trial. Sparring is race-fit (2nd at Cranbourne 955m on 6 Feb, just 0.4L off winner) and has Craig Williams aboard - a significant jockey upgrade. The EW maths work: combined EW EV of +7.1%, driven by place EV of +15.3% at $2.50 place odds. His 54.2% place probability provides a solid safety net against the $2.50 place return.

## EACH-WAY DETAIL

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win EV | -1.0% |
| Place EV | +15.3% |
| Combined EW EV | +7.1% |
| Place Prob | 54.2% |
| Place Odds | $2.50 |
| Specialist Score | 0.75 (non-specialist) |
| EW Path | A (Odds >= $5.50, EW_EV +7.1%, Place 54%) |

## PLACE SPECIALIST NOTE

**#5 Tookay Pete** - Strong Place Specialist score of 1.786 (55% career place rate vs 30.8% expected). However, the massive class rise from BM56-66 to Listed level makes EW untenable at $7.00/$3.10 despite the placing profile. EW EV of -16.2%.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Rain impact**: Conditions may deteriorate - Good 4 with rain could shift to Soft. Sparring has 2/6 soft wins (OK), but Katsu improves on wet (3/7).
2. **Katsu freshness**: If Katsu has maintained his BM84+ ability through the spell, he's clearly the best horse. Trial wins are encouraging but uncertain guide at this level.
