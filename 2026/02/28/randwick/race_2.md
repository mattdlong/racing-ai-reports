## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Neil has the best raw times at this distance (60.85s/1010m Murwillumbah Soft). Sir Franklin clocked 59.58s/1010m (Soft) and 45.77s/800m at Goulburn. Tough Guy ran 57.12s/1000m on Good at Tamworth. Limited sectional data across the field.

**Pace**: CONTESTED - multiple natural speed horses (Sir Franklin, Brave Xena, Tough Guy, Blue De Beers) should ensure honest tempo over 1000m. Suits on-pace runners in good barriers. Neil (bar 5) and Sir Franklin (bar 4) positioned to stalk.

**Class**: Neil drops from CL3 metro-equivalent. Zampano drops from BM66. Sir Franklin has been winning country BM58/Open-BT level - lateral move but first metro test. Brave Xena rising sharply from country CL1 maiden grade. Mrs Goldberg stepping from provincial 3Y Hcp.

**Bias**: Neutral bias declared (LOW confidence). Soft 7 with rain - may deteriorate further to Heavy range. Inside barriers and on-pace runners historically advantaged in wet Randwick 1000m races.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Sir Franklin** at $14 represents the best value proposition in the race. He's a proven soft track performer (3 wins, 2 places from 5 starts on soft/heavy), carries the highest weight but from an ideal barrier (4), and returns from a 200-day spell having won a barrier trial at Goulburn by 0.74L on Good. The Adam Hyeronimus booking is competent. His country form (3 wins from 7, all on wet tracks) translates well to a deteriorating Randwick surface. At $14 he offers +12% edge with genuine EW value (EW EV +9.1%). The place specialist score (1.36) confirms he places more often than his win rate suggests - career 100% placing rate (7 from 7).

**Neil** ($4.40 FAV) is the most likely winner with Rawiller aboard, Randwick Heavy track winner, and the best class credentials dropping from CL3. However, at $4.40 he's a clear underlay (fair odds ~$5) with no betting value. He's the one to beat but not the one to back.

## KEY RISKS

1. Sir Franklin 200 days off - fitness query despite barrier trial win; first metro start is a class unknown
2. Deteriorating track (Soft 7 + Rain) could move to Heavy, reshuffling the speed figures entirely
3. Large field (15r) over 1000m creates traffic risks, especially from mid-barriers outward
