## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Enriched posted dominant trial win (4.2L) at Randwick on soft, figures translate strongly to 1300m; Axius won MM Sprint on soft and has best peak figure.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - Coal Crusher and The Instructor likely to press forward, Willaidow midfield. Enough speed to suit on-pace runners without a mugging pace.
**Class**: Group 3 level. Axius rising sharply from BM78, Enriched from Open BT but 3-from-10 career (30% strike). King Of Roseau won MM Cup (Listed) last start. Militarize is a Group 1 winner but resuming off 111 days with two poor trials.
**Bias**: Soft 7 with rain - track likely to deteriorate further. Runners with proven wet form critical. Axius (5/8 on soft/heavy), Coal Crusher (7/24), Cool Jakey (6/17) all handle it. Enriched only 1/3 on soft - query.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Enriched** (#10, $8.50 EW) is the value play. Dominant 4.2L barrier trial winner at Randwick on soft 9 days ago suggests he's primed for a big first-up run. Course specialist (2 wins from 3 at Randwick) with Michael Freedman in strong form. The $8.50 represents +19% edge with strong EW value (EV +10.4%). Inside barrier (3) is ideal in soft ground. The concern is limited wet track starts (1/3) but the recent trial on soft was emphatic.

**Coal Crusher** (#1, $13.00 EW) is the each-way saver. The 8yo is a proven wet-tracker (7 wins/places from 24 on soft+, including 4/8 on heavy). Distance specialist at 1300m (5 wins from 12 starts). Won The Hunter at Newcastle (1300m, Good) in strong fashion. At $13 the +30% edge and +18.8% EW EV make him a must-include at the price. Barrier 4 is ideal.

**Axius** (#9, $4.50) is the most likely winner on ability but is close to fair price with no edge. Won MM Sprint and has 56% career strike rate, but rising sharply in class to Group 3 level from BM78 grade. Pass on win bet at current odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. Enriched's limited soft track record (1 win from 3 on soft, 0 from 0 on heavy) - if track deteriorates to Heavy, he may struggle
2. Coal Crusher is 8yo - age regression risk, and only 1 win from 19 Randwick starts (course form poor)
3. Axius may simply be too talented - if he wins, the overlays don't collect
