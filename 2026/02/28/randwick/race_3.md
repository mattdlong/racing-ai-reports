## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited time data available; Bear On The Loose and Nkosi showed the best recent figures in comparable company. Unlimited has strong Randwick 2000m wins but on good tracks only.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Bear On The Loose (bar 3) and Casual Connection (bar 2) can settle forward without burning fuel. Nkosi likely midfield from wide draw.
**Class**: BM96 is a significant class rise for many - Nkosi (from BM88), Casual Connection (from BM78), Kenmare Bay (from BM78). Bear On The Loose's BM88+ form is the most relevant at this level.
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected (LOW confidence). Soft 7 track is the dominant factor - dramatically narrows the effective field.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#12 Nkosi** qualifies as EW VALUE via Path B (Place Specialist score 3.71). This 4yo has explosive wet-track form: 3 wins from 6 starts on soft/heavy including a dominant 4L win at Wyong on heavy. Won impressively at Rosehill (1800m, soft) defeating Glad You Think So by 2.3L. Stepping to 2000m for the first time is the key risk, but won at 2100m in NZ and was runner-up at 1900m Rosehill. The $14 price significantly underestimates his wet-track ability. Wide draw (15) is a concern but with a moderate tempo he can find a midfield position.

**#9 Casual Connection** is the longshot value play at $27. A proven wet-track stayer with 6 wins from 24 starts on soft/heavy. Won at Randwick 2400m on heavy. Has the inside draw (bar 2) and the staying trip suits. Class rise from BM78 to BM96 is significant but he's a consistent placer (43% career place rate) who thrives when the ground is testing.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Nkosi**: Wide barrier (15) in 15-runner field; untried at exactly 2000m; class rise from BM88
2. **Casual Connection**: Significant class rise (BM78 to BM96); only 1 win from 7 on good (but Soft 7 helps)
3. **Bear On The Loose**: Market favourite at $3.50 but no win at Randwick (0/4) and no win at 2000m (0/5) despite constant placing
