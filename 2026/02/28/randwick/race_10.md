## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Charcoals has the best 1200m figures (4 wins from 5 at the trip including BM84 wins), Cloudland won BM94 at 1200m on heavy at Rosehill. Both are sharp enough at this class.
**Pace**: MODERATE - multiple on-pace types (Bev's Nine, Mal Coupe, Roselyn's Star, Cloudland) should ensure honest tempo in the soft. No clear speed-on scenario but enough pace to suit runners with tactical ability.
**Class**: Mal Coupe is the big query - jumping from BM72 to BM88 is a significant class rise despite the impressive winning streak. Bev's Nine (BM78 last start) also makes a huge leap. Meanwhile Cloudland and Charcoals have proven BM88+ form.
**Bias**: Low confidence on bias data. Soft 7 with rain - conditions will deteriorate further. Horses with wet-track credentials are essential. Roselyn's Star (0/5 soft/heavy) is a strong fade.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Cloudland** ($21 EW) is the standout value play at massive odds. He won a BM94 on heavy at Rosehill (1200m) and has a 6/15 strike rate on soft/heavy tracks. Barrier 3 is ideal, and while he's resuming off 113 days, he's trialled twice (4th and 5th in competitive trials at Randwick/Wyong). At $21, the market grossly underestimates his wet-track ability at this class. Place specialist score of 4.3 adds EW appeal.

**Charcoals** ($14 EW) has a remarkable 4/5 record at 1200m including BM84 wins in Melbourne. The 140-day absence is a concern, but he trialled twice (3rd at Randwick, 4th at Canterbury) showing readiness. Tommy Berry booking is a positive. At $14 with +19% win edge and +12.6% EW EV, he offers genuine value despite the wide gate.

## MARKET WATCH

**Mal Coupe** ($3.70) and **Bev's Nine** ($5.50) dominate the market but both face significant unknowns. Mal Coupe has never raced beyond 1000m in a proper race - the step to 1200m on a heavy deck at BM88 is a massive ask despite his talent. Bev's Nine has never raced at 1200m at all. Both are WATCH - talented but too short for the risks.

## KEY RISKS

1. Both selections are resuming off long breaks (113 and 140 days) - fitness is the primary concern
2. Charcoals draws barrier 12 in a 14-horse field on soft - will need luck from wide
