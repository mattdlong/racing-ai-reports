## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Pembrey posted the standout figure - won debut at Eagle Farm by 5.4L in 57.49s over 1000m on soft. Visually dominant; no other runner has a comparable raw time advantage at the distance.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Pembrey will lead or sit outside the pace from barrier 6. Lumbini (5) and Hardanger (3) best drawn of those with tactical speed. No confirmed speed-on runners to pressure Pembrey.
**Class**: Group 2 level. All runners are 2yo fillies with limited race experience (1-3 starts). Pembrey, Spicy Miss (Golden Gift 2nd), and By Choice (Randwick winner) have the highest-class form lines. Hardanger ran 3rd in the Widden Stakes behind strong company.
**Bias**: Soft 7 with rain - track will be wet. Pembrey (1:1-0 soft) and Lumbini (2:1-2 soft) only runners with winning soft form. By Choice (2:0-1 soft), Ciaron's Star (0 soft starts), Spicy Miss (0 soft starts) all with question marks.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Pembrey is clearly the best horse in the race but at $1.95 represents a -25.9% underlay with fair odds of $2.63. She's untested at 1200m and at Randwick, making her poor value despite obvious ability. The EW angle on **Hardanger** at $18 offers +8% win edge and +17% EW EV. She ran 3rd in the Widden Stakes (0.32L off the winner), is drawn perfectly in barrier 3 with Tommy Berry aboard, and the Freedman stable is in form. The Widden form is rock-solid for this and she's the only runner besides Pembrey and Lumbini with meaningful wet-track adjacent form (ran on Heavy at Warwick Farm). At the price, she represents legitimate each-way value.

## KEY RISKS

1. Hardanger has 0 wins from 2 starts - maiden in a Group 2, needs significant improvement
2. Pembrey could simply be too good regardless of price - if she leads and kicks, nothing catches her
3. Soft 7 track may deteriorate further with rain; all 2yo form is lightly tested on wet
