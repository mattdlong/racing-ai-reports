## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Manaal holds the best speed figures from Invitation (4th, 0.33L) and Gold Pendant win (1st). Verona Rose's Inglis Bracelet win at Flemington rates next best. It's A Knockout won BM78 at Randwick 1400m soft by 4.14L - huge effort that rates strongly for this grade.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No confirmed leaders in the field. Manaal (barrier 9) and Gerringong (barrier 2) likely settle midfield-to-on-pace. It's A Knockout is a genuine backmarker who needs a solid tempo to close. The Soft 7 should ensure honest speed throughout.

**Class**: Manaal has contested Invitation and Gold Pendant level - significant class drop to BM88. Verona Rose ran in the Epsom and Inglis Bracelet. Both are class standouts. It's A Knockout won BM78 last prep and ran 3rd in BM88 at Randwick - class appropriate. Firestorm and Gerringong also have stakes-level experience.

**Bias**: Neutral bias confidence (LOW data). Soft 7 track will favour wet-trackers. Inside barriers advantaged slightly on rain-affected Randwick.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#1 Manaal** is the class horse of the race dropping sharply from Invitation level to BM88. Outstanding wet-track record (3 wins, 3 places from 5 soft/heavy starts). Third-up off a solid 2nd in the Triscay Stakes (1200m), stepping to his preferred 1400m. Jason Collett/Freedman combination in strong form. The win edge is marginal (+0.8%) but the EW value is compelling at +10.6% with a 73% modelled place probability. Barrier 9 is the main concern but manageable in an 11-horse field.

**#11 It's A Knockout** is the speculative EW play. Superb wet-track credentials (2 wins, 5 places from 6 soft starts), including a dominant 4.14L BM78 win at Randwick 1400m on soft. Place specialist score of 2.33 (strong). The $27 price vastly underrates this horse's wet-track ability. Barrier 12 is a negative, but Tim Clark can ride a patient race from the back. At the price, the EW value is significant.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Manaal** (barrier 9): Could be caught wide without cover if pace is slow; only 2 prior 1400m starts this prep (both shorter sprints in trials)
2. **It's A Knockout** (barrier 12): Widest gate in the field, backmarker style means vulnerable if pace collapses; form this prep slightly below best (7th BM88 Randwick 1600m last start)
3. **Soft 7 wildcard**: Track could deteriorate further if rain persists - benefits wet-trackers more but creates unpredictability
