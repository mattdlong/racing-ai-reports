## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Autumn Glow's Epsom (93.14s/1600m Good) and Apollo (82.11s/1400m) are best-in-field figures by clear margin; Ceolwulf's Cantala win (98.94s Soft) and King Charles III (94.39s) show Group 1 speed at the trip.
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected - limited early speed in field, Autumn Glow likely to control from on-pace, suits her pattern. Ceolwulf can settle midfield and finish strongly.
**Class**: Autumn Glow (9/9, Epsom/Golden Eagle winner) is clearly the class act. Sir Delius (Turnbull/Underwood G1 winner) has peak form but 146 days off. Ceolwulf (Cantala/King Charles III G1 winner) is proven at this level over 1600m. Trinity College (Hampton Court winner at Royal Ascot) has international class but first run at Randwick.
**Bias**: Soft 7, no significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. Neutral assessment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Ceolwulf at $14 represents the best value in the race via Each-Way Path B (Place Specialist score 2.80). He's a dual Group 1 winner at 1600m with a 54% career place rate (14/26). His Cantala Stakes win on Soft and 3/6 soft track record confirms wet aptitude. Drawn barrier 2, he'll get an economical run on the fence. While Autumn Glow is clearly superior, she's priced as if unbeatable at $1.35 (-25.7% underlay) and the Soft 7 is her first genuine test on rain-affected ground beyond Heavy 1100m. Ceolwulf's EW value (+8.2% EW EV, +12% win edge) makes him the play at the price for each-way punters looking to oppose the odds-on favourite.

## KEY RISKS

1. Autumn Glow is a genuine freak - 9/9 unbeaten including G1 Epsom and Golden Eagle; may simply be too good regardless of conditions
2. Ceolwulf's last 2 starts (6th Apollo, 3rd barrier trial) are below his best; needs to recapture spring form
3. Soft 7 track could deteriorate further, introducing unpredictability for all runners
