## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Fireball posts top figure (92) from Millennium win; Warwoven (90) and Star Of Jamaica (89) next best. Clear separation from rest of field.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - Warwoven (bar 1) and Concrete Storm (bar 2) can roll forward; Fireball will need to overcome wide draw to settle midfield. No extreme speed, which suits the quality horses.
**Class**: Both Fireball (Millennium winner) and Warwoven (dominant 2yo wins) have Group race credentials. Star Of Jamaica was competitive in the Millennium (4th, beaten 0.62L). Significant class rise for debutants Central Europe, Concrete Storm, Spring Ruler, and Zensen.
**Bias**: Soft 7 track with rain - historically Randwick soft tracks show no strong bias pattern. Barrier 1 (Warwoven) is advantageous; barriers 11-14 face a slight disadvantage. Warwoven has a Soft track win; Fireball is untested on soft (0 starts).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Fireball is the value play in a race dominated by two unbeaten colts. His Millennium win (1100m, Good, 63.61s) is the best speed figure in the race and he's proven at Randwick. At $6.50 with 18% estimated win probability, he offers +17% edge and strong EW value (+15.3% EW EV). The each-way component is critical - 68.8% place probability at $1.95 place odds provides significant downside protection. James McDonald is the x-factor from the wide gate. Warwoven is the clear market leader and best-rated horse on integrated score (82.8), but $2.15 represents a 40% underlay on our 28% win probability - there is no value backing him at that price, particularly with the wet track query (only 1 soft start) and 55-day break.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Fireball untested on soft** - Both career wins on Good tracks; Soft 7 is a genuine unknown and barrier 12 compounds the challenge
2. **Warwoven's class and draw advantage** - Barrier 1 on a soft track with proven wet form (1/1 soft) could see him control this from the front

## EACH-WAY VALUE

| Horse | Win EV | Place EV | EW EV | Rating |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Fireball | +17.0% | +13.5% | +15.3% | STRONG EW VALUE |
| Star Of Jamaica | +4.0% | -6.0% | -1.0% | NO VALUE |
| Knightsbridge | -5.0% | -24.1% | -14.5% | NO VALUE |
