## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Bryant has the best raw figure (78) but off a weaker BM64 at Warwick Farm; Shaggy's 76 at BM72 Canterbury is the most impressive at-level figure. Zoutastic's dominant 1000m Hawkesbury win (58.06s) suggests pace ability to burn.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - Zoutastic, All Too Wild and Los Padres likely to push forward. Suits midfield runners like Shaggy who can stalk and pounce. No obvious leader collapse scenario.
**Class**: Dropping class for Shaggy (BM72 to BM68) and Zoutastic (BM72 to BM68) are key positives. Bryant rises from BM64 maiden-break quality. Zaragoza drops from BM84 but has 0 wins from 6 at Randwick 1100m.
**Bias**: Soft 7 track - neutral bias with LOW confidence. Shaggy's soft track form (2/7, 29%) is adequate. Bryant untested on Soft 7 (0/2 on soft, 1 placing). Zoutastic has poor soft record (0/6, 0 wins) which is a concern.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Shaggy** ($8.50 EW) is the primary selection. The 3yo gelding drops from BM72 to BM68, has strong recent form (2nd beaten 0.14L, 3rd beaten 0.19L at Canterbury BM72), and is a confirmed STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score 2.47, career 73% placing rate). Barrier 5 is ideal in a 13-runner field, and Mollie Fitzgerald's 3kg claim provides a genuine weight advantage. The EW value is strong via Path A (EV +12.3%, place prob 37%) and Path B (specialist score 2.47). Fair odds $7.14 vs market $8.50 gives +19% edge.

**Zoutastic** ($12.00 EW) is the secondary selection. Tommy Berry riding is a plus, and the horse is a place specialist (score 2.33) who won impressively at Hawkesbury (3.56L margin). The concern is 0/6 on soft tracks, but the EW value via Path B (specialist + odds $12) is compelling at +20% edge. The 12.3% EW EV justifies a smaller stake.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft 7 ground**: Zoutastic 0/6 on soft - genuine concern; Shaggy more proven (2/7) but not dominant
2. **Bryant first-time blinkers**: Favourite at $4.00 with blinkers on, wide barrier 12 - if gear change sparks improvement, could take this; but no value at the price (-20% edge)
3. **Market compression**: If Shaggy firms below $7.00, EW value evaporates - monitor pre-race
