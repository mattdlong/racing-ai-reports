## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Hatchet posted the fastest raw time (67.95s at Doomben), but that was a small field (7r) on Good. Hell and Battlefield ran 2nd/3rd that same BM90 at Sunshine Coast (70.41s) - competitive field, tight finishes. Battlefield's 82.12s over 1400m last start converts to strong 1200m potential.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Hatchet and Hell likely to sit handy from barriers 9 and 2 respectively. Battlefield (6) can stalk. No dominant leader, which suits on-pace runners. Hell's inside draw (2) gives a significant tactical advantage on a wet track.

**Class**: All contenders have BM85-90 form. Battlefield's CL6 win last start and Hatchet's HCP win are at equivalent level. Hell rising from BM78 win but has run well at BM85+ previously.

**Bias**: Soft 7 with rain - genuine wet track. No detected bias (LOW confidence), but inside barriers and on-pace runners historically advantaged on rain-affected Eagle Farm.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Hell (#5) is the value play at $4.80. Outstanding wet track credentials (5 wins, 9 placings from 12 soft/heavy starts = 75% place rate), a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST score of 1.61. Inside barrier (2) is a major advantage on Soft 7 - saves ground and avoids kickback. The Tony Gollan stable is strong at Eagle Farm. Won a BM78 here two starts back on Soft, then chased home Hatchet at Doomben in a solid 3rd. The step to BM90 is the query, but the conditions strongly suit. EW bet provides insurance via the elite place rate. EW EV is +5.0% with place EV at +9.2%.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise from BM78 to BM90 - yet to win at this level
2. Hatchet and Battlefield both have superior peak form and class credentials
3. Market has Hell equal-favourite with Hatchet - not much overlay

## PLACE SPECIALIST FLAGS

- #5 Hell: **STRONG** (1.61) - 77% career place rate, elite on wet
- #4 Vodka Martini: **STRONG** (3.08) - but stepping up from 1000m
- #9 Pocket Full: **STRONG** (1.79) - but poor recent form
- #1 Hatchet: **SPECIALIST** (1.34) - 58% career place rate
