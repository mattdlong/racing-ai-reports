## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figure holder - wide-open race on class. Slippin' Jimmy's 41% career SR and 83.68s last 1400m EF run competitive.
**Pace**: MODERATE - enough early speed from John Rambo, Ser Joh, and Castillian to ensure genuine tempo. Mid-field stalkers advantaged.
**Class**: Big class rise for Earl Of Bantry (BM70) and Streak Of Winning (BM70) makes them vulnerable. Slippin' Jimmy at BM85 level with upside.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Soft 7 with rain - track likely to deteriorate further. Wet-track form critical differentiator.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Slippin' Jimmy is the clear value play at $15. The 5yo has a remarkable wet-track record (4/8 soft, 1/2 heavy = 50% SR on rain-affected) and a career 41% win rate from 17 starts. Third on this course 14 days ago over 1200m BM85 (0.65L margin), he now steps to his preferred 1400m where he's 2/5. Vandyke stable in form. The market has him at $15 despite being a genuine top-4 contender on the conditions - qualifies across ALL THREE each-way value paths (A, B, C) with an EW score of 81.2. Place specialist score of 2.8x confirms strong place consistency (71% career place rate). John Rambo is the deserved favourite but grossly overbet at $4.20 in a 15-runner field on Soft 7.

## KEY RISKS

1. Stepping from 1200m to 1400m second-up - though has strong distance record (2/5)
2. Barrier 6 mid-field in large field - needs clean run in transit
