## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Earn To Burn holds the best raw figure (56.18s EF 1000m Good), 2+ lengths clear of field on adjusted times. Forgotten Spirit (57.12s EF Soft) and Isti Star (57.39s GC Soft) next best but a clear gap to the favourite.

**Pace**: FAST scenario expected with multiple keen on-pace runners (Earn To Burn, Dragonne Rouge, Dr Farthing all forward). In a 1000m sprint on Soft 7, the pace pressure could set up closers if it becomes contested.

**Class**: BM68 3YO race. Isti Star has the highest average prizemoney ($137k) suggesting superior class but returning from 258 days off. Earn To Burn stepping up after BM68 win at Sunshine Coast on soft - proven at level. Casino Bay rising sharply from CL1 country form.

**Bias**: Neutral bias confidence LOW. Soft 7 with rain favours proven wet-trackers. Barrier draws 9-13 are a concern in a 1000m sprint - inside barriers have a natural advantage.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Casino Bay** (#7 @ $17) rates as the each-way value play. Unbeaten in 2 career starts (Sunshine Coast CL1, Toowoomba Heavy), 100% place rate (4/4), place specialist score of 5.95. The won on Heavy at Toowoomba suggests the Soft 7 won't be an issue. Barrier 6 gives a genuine midfield position without needing to work from wide. Rising through the grades quickly and the $17 quote underestimates the upside. EW EV +35%.

**Dragonne Rouge** (#4 @ $16) is the secondary EW play. Barrier 1 is a significant advantage in a 1000m dash on soft ground - can park on the rail and save ground. Wet track specialist (3/7 wins on soft/heavy including Calaway Gal Stakes on heavy). Recent form (6th, 11th, 8th) is all at 1200-1400m - dropping back to 1000m suits as her best wins were at shorter trips. EW EV +13%.

**Earn To Burn** (#1) is the likely winner (34% probability) with the best speed figure and proven soft form (3/5), but at $2.60 the price doesn't offer value (fair odds $2.94, edge -11.6%). Respect, don't back.

## KEY RISKS

1. Casino Bay is untried on soft (0 soft starts) - the Heavy win suggests adaptability but Soft 7 is different
2. Earn To Burn is clearly the class runner and may simply be too good for this field regardless of price
3. Dragonne Rouge's recent form is poor (3 runs for 6th, 11th, 8th) even accounting for distance excuses
