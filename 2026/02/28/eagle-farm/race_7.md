## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figure on adjusted ratings. Savagery Vibe's 71.25s Eagle Farm Soft win is the benchmark but came in BM70.
**Pace**: MODERATE - enough speed from Restonica, Estrondo, and Break Free to ensure genuine tempo. Mid-runners advantaged.
**Class**: Savagery Vibe and Break Free both rising sharply (BM70/NMW to BM78). Estrondo drops from BM85. Cheval Chic and Amore Veloce at level.
**Bias**: Soft 7 with rain = deteriorating. Rail position unknown. Neutral bias with LOW confidence per briefing data. Wet track form becomes the dominant factor.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Amore Veloce is a proven wet track performer (5/11 on soft/heavy including 4/7 soft) with elite 1200m distance stats (6 wins from 20 starts). She's massively overlooked at $23 after a poor dry-track campaign - her last two runs were on Good ground where she's just 1/15. The shift to Soft 7 with continuing rain transforms her profile entirely. Barrier 6 is ideal, and Robert Heathcote knows this mare's wet track ability. Place specialist score of 2.75 is the highest in the field. The EW value at +61.5% EV qualifies via Path B (place specialist at big odds).

Cheval Chic is the WATCH runner - her heavy track record (3/4) is extraordinary, and if conditions deteriorate further toward Heavy she becomes a genuine win contender from barrier 1. The concern is her soft track record (0/7) - Soft 7 may not be wet enough. The +14% edge is marginal with the confidence interval crossing zero.

## KEY RISKS

1. Amore Veloce has been racing over shorter (1000m) recently - fitness for 1200m on a heavy surface is the key query
2. If rain eases and track improves toward Soft 5-6, the wet track edge diminishes significantly
3. Savagery Vibe won on Soft here 2 weeks ago and is the class runner - if she handles the class rise she wins easily
