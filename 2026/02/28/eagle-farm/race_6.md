## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Noble Conqueror produced the best recent figure winning EF 1600m BM85 in 96.83s (Soft) two weeks ago, beating Nails Murphy 0.2L with Demon Darb 7th. Prior to that, won EF 1810m BM80 in 110.05s (Good) by 0.76L.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Quothquan and Nails Murphy likely to press forward. Noble Conqueror races on-speed and settles 2nd/3rd, ideal in this scenario. Mid-barrier (6) allows tactical options.

**Class**: Noble Conqueror is rising sharply through the grades - three wins from last four starts (CL3 -> BM80 -> BM85). Still looks well-in with 52.5kg after the claim. Nails Murphy consistent at BM85 level but lacks win edge at $3.40. Quothquan stepping up from BM78 with 0 course wins from 9 starts - concerning.

**Bias**: Neutral bias expected (LOW confidence). Soft 7 with rain favours proven wet-trackers. Noble Conqueror: 1/15 on soft (poor) is the key risk. Nails Murphy 1/10 soft. Demon Darb 5/14 soft (best wet record). Glory Daze 4/9 soft (outstanding wet form but resuming from 146 days).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Noble Conqueror is the clear value play at $8.00, offering +44% edge. He won this same race (EF BM85 1600m Soft) two weeks ago beating several of today's re-opposing rivals including Nails Murphy (2nd, +0.2L) and Demon Darb (7th). His form trajectory of 7-7-1-2-1-1 shows a horse in career-best form under Chris Waller's Brisbane operation. The 52.5kg after claim is a significant advantage, and barrier 6 is ideal for his on-pace racing style. At $8.00 vs fair odds of $5.56, this is a strong each-way proposition with 47% place probability. EW EV is +36.6% via Path A.

The main query is favourite Nails Murphy ($3.40) who is ultra-consistent (6 wins, 19 places from 28 starts, 68% place rate) but doesn't offer value at current odds. His fair price is $4.17 — he's 18% overbacked. He's the most likely winner but not the value play.

## KEY RISKS

1. Noble Conqueror's soft track record (1/15) is poor despite winning on Soft last start — sample may be misleading given career-best form trajectory
2. Wide barrier (11) for Nails Murphy could force wide run, but as favourite the market hasn't adjusted
