## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Akkadian Emperor has the best raw figures (won BM80 last start) but all on good tracks; no proven soft form translates here. Whatjeudoin' and Lovey Dovey have the best recent winning times on soft ground.
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected. Large field with several on-pacers (#1, #13, #9) should create an honest tempo. Mid-runners and closers get their chance over 2200m.
**Class**: Akkadian Emperor dropping from BM80 but Soft 7 negates advantage. Whatjeudoin' rising from BM58 off strong 2.5L win on soft - progressive. Guarded Optimist has 4 wins from 14 soft starts, all at this class level. Lovey Dovey up from BM65 after back-to-back wins.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Rail position unknown. Soft 7 with rain = genuine wet track, favours proven wet-trackers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#15 Whatjeudoin' ($21 EW)**: The standout value play. Won last start at Ipswich on soft by 2.5L in a BM58 (135.22s/2180m), with a record of 4 wins from 21 soft starts (19%). Remarkable place consistency - 49% career place rate (24 placings from 37 starts). Six distance starts for 1 win. Rising in class from BM58 to BM70 is the knock, but the EW value at $21 is compelling: +68% edge on win, +50% EW EV, place specialist score of 3.22. Wide barrier (16) is manageable over 2200m with genuine tempo expected.

**#4 Guarded Optimist ($27 EW)**: The wet track specialist at value odds. 4 wins from 14 soft starts (29%) vs 0/5 on good. Gets the inside barrier (4) in a 16-runner field. Last 3 runs all on good/soft surfaces show him building towards this. At $27, the edge is +116% with a strong EW EV of +98%. Has 4 starts at Eagle Farm for 0 wins which tempers enthusiasm, keeping this as a secondary play.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Class rise for Whatjeudoin'** - jumping from BM58 to BM70 is a significant 12-point class rise; may find these too strong
2. **Akkadian Emperor's class** - despite 0/9 wet, class is king and he's proven at BM80; a first soft win at short odds would be costly to oppose
3. **Track deterioration** - if the Soft 7 moves to Heavy, the form guide reshuffles further; #5 Caracoron (2/2 heavy) becomes the danger
