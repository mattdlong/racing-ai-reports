## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: So Long Farewell posted fastest raw time at the trip (108.04s Eagle Farm 1800m) but in weaker BM68 grade on good ground. Rezone's BM70 win at 95.3s/1600m + 112.15s/1820m on soft shows genuine ability on rain-affected.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Limited early speed in the field; Brindavan and So Long Farewell likely to settle on-pace. Rezone can position midfield with cover from barrier 5. Shape suits on-pace and midfield runners.
**Class**: Rezone rises sharply from BM70 to BM78 after 3 consecutive wins - trajectory is strong but step-up is the key risk. So Long Farewell makes the biggest class jump (BM68 to BM78). Pure Alpha and Rock Hard Love are at their level (BM78). Brindavan drops slightly from BM80.
**Bias**: No significant track bias data (LOW confidence). Soft 7 with rain is the dominant factor - wet track form becomes the primary differentiator in this race.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Rezone** is the top selection on the strength of three consecutive wins, strong Soft track form (2/8, 3 places), and getting the ideal 1800m trip after a close 2nd over 1820m at Eagle Farm on soft last start. The barrier 5 draw allows an economical run in transit. At $5.50 he represents +10% edge with genuine EW value (EW EV +6.8%, place specialist score 1.63). The class rise from BM70 is the concern, but the trajectory justifies the step.

**Rock Hard Love** offers the highest edge at +21% and is a proven wet-tracker (3/10 soft, 1/1 heavy). His career place rate of 71.4% relative to win probability gives a place specialist score of 3.09 - the strongest in the field. At $11 EW the numbers are compelling (EW EV +13.4%) despite the wide barrier 10 and quick back-up (6 days).

**Pure Alpha** gets a wet track upgrade. His record of 1/9 soft and 1/4 heavy shows he relishes rain-affected ground. Two runs of placed form at BM78 in Sydney (2nd Randwick, 2nd Rosehill on good/soft) confirm he's at this level. At $9.50 there's +14% edge.

**Against Brindavan**: The $2.70 favourite has ZERO wins and ZERO places from 2 starts on soft ground. On a Soft 7 with rain, this is a fatal flaw - he's a massive underlay at -51.4%.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rezone's BM70-to-BM78 class rise is significant (3 benchmark points) - may find this too tough first time at this level
2. Rock Hard Love backing up after only 6 days and drawn barrier 10 in a 12-horse field
3. Track could deteriorate further to Heavy with ongoing rain, which would hurt all but the most proven wet-trackers
