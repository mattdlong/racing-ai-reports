## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Concession posts the best raw Eagle Farm 1000m times (56.41s Good, 56.59s Soft) - 0.4-0.6s clear of Cabaletto (57.02s Good, 57.18s Soft). Seymour Stars and Hey Daisy untested at this level with provincial-only clockings.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Concession (bar 2), Hey Daisy (bar 3), and Seymour Stars (bar 5) should find positions. Galactic Star (bar 10) disadvantaged in a 1000m sprint. Enough speed in the race to set a genuine tempo without it being suicidal.

**Class**: Significant class rise for several. Seymour Stars (3 from 3 but all country CL2 or below) faces a massive step up to metro BM70. Hey Daisy jumps from CL1 provincial. Cabaletto has metro form (3rd Eagle Farm 1000m in a first-starter event) but 115 days off. Concession is the only runner with proven BM70 form at Eagle Farm - 4th and 7th in this grade here.

**Bias**: Neutral bias reported (LOW confidence). Soft 7 with rain - track likely to deteriorate further. Inside barriers hold a natural advantage at EF 1000m.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Concession is the value play at $8.50 in a race where every other contender has a significant question mark. He has the best proven Eagle Farm 1000m speed figures in the field and is the only runner with demonstrated BM70 metro form at this track. While his last two starts (4th, 7th) don't leap off the page, both were competitive in this exact grade at Eagle Farm on rain-affected tracks - beaten less than a length when 4th here 9 days ago. Barrier 2 is ideal for the 1000m, he handles soft ground (1/5 wins, 2/5 places), and at $8.50 vs a fair price of $6.67, there's strong each-way value with a 41.6% place probability.

The short-priced trio (Cabaletto $4, Hey Daisy $3.80, Seymour Stars $4.20) all have legitimate claims but carry substantial risks that aren't priced in. Cabaletto resumes after 115 days with only a barrier trial 18 days ago. Hey Daisy has never raced at Eagle Farm and rises sharply from provincial CL1. Seymour Stars is unbeaten but entirely in country/provincial company - a huge metro jump.

## KEY RISKS

1. Concession has won only 1 of 5 at Eagle Farm despite competitive runs - may be a track where he places not wins
2. Soft 7 deteriorating to heavy could bring Seymour Stars (won on Heavy at Coffs by 8.65L) into the picture as an improver
