## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Areprice holds the top figure (88) from a dominant 5.1L debut win at Doomben 1110m - significantly clear of the field. Swift Dragon next best (72) but flopped last start at Eagle Farm.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Areprice will likely lead or sit handy from barrier 6. Swift Dragon and Boomtowns also have tactical speed. No extreme pressure expected with 9 runners over 1000m.

**Class**: All runners are 2YOs with minimal racing experience. Areprice's maiden win margin (5.1L) is the standout achievement. Boomtowns and Final Crusade are untested debutants for Tony Gollan - market respects the stable but no race form to assess.

**Bias**: Soft 7 with rain is the critical factor. Areprice has NEVER raced on soft/heavy (1 start on Good only). Swift Dragon is 1/2 on soft. Tosen Sabi raced on soft once (5th at Eagle Farm). This is a significant unknown for the favourite.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Tosen Sabi qualifies as an EW value play via Path B (Place Specialist). At $34, the market has dismissed this horse but the form warrants inclusion: won maiden at Toowoomba 1000m, won latest start at Gatton 860m (3 days ago), and draws barrier 1 which is ideal in a soft-track 1000m sprint. The inside draw on a rain-affected track provides a significant advantage. The place specialist score of 3.47 reflects a horse that consistently runs close to its mark. At $6.75 the place, there's genuine EW value even with modest place probability (19.4%).

Areprice is clearly the best horse on raw form but $2.25 is far too short given: (1) untested on soft ground - this is a Soft 7 with rain, a massive unknown, (2) dropping from 1110m to 1000m, (3) 41-day gap, (4) only 1 career start. Fair odds $3.03 make this a clear underlay.

## KEY RISKS

1. Tosen Sabi's last win was at Gatton (weak provincial form) - may be outclassed at Eagle Farm metro
2. Two Gollan debutants (Boomtowns, Final Crusade) are unknowns who could run any sort of race
3. Areprice's class may simply be too good regardless of conditions - 5.1L margin is rare for a 2YO
