## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Gin Twist has the best raw time at 1000m (57.23s Pakenham), with Ladhar competitive (57.55s in stronger Debutant Stakes at Caulfield). Most debutants are unraced so speed comparison is limited.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Harry Met Sally and Jacaranda likely forward; Gin Twist can stalk from barrier 4. No confirmed leader creates uncertainty in a small 2YO field.
**Class**: Juvenile maiden, minimal class separation. Jacaranda the only winner (Seymour maiden, beat 2), while Gin Twist has two metro placings at Caulfield and Pakenham. Ladhar ran in Debutant Stakes (Listed equivalent).
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence), no rail position specified. Rain forecast may develop into soft range - monitor.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**The Troubleshooter** ($19 EW) is the speculative value play. Won both jump-outs impressively for John Sadler, including most recent on 17 Feb (won from 5 runners) and 10 Feb (won from 8 runners). At $19, the market is dismissing a debut runner from a top stable with strong trial form. EW EV is +37.0% with win edge +52.0%. The risk is zero race day experience and wide barrier 8, but the price compensates handsomely.

**Gin Twist** ($3.90 EW) is the safety selection. Best speed figure in the field from her 3rd at Pakenham (57.23s), followed by 3rd at Caulfield (58.38s, beaten 0.75L). Two from two in placings makes her a strong place specialist (score 1.74). EW EV is +5.1% driven entirely by place value (+16.6%). The Hayes stable has three runners here (also Jacaranda and La Gitana), suggesting confidence is spread, but Gin Twist gets the best jockey booking in Luke Currie.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Rain impact**: Good 4 with rain forecast - if track deteriorates to Soft, no runner has wet form to assess
2. **2YO debut uncertainty**: 4 of 8 runners are debutants with trial-only form; race fitness vs race experience is the great unknown
3. **Barrier 8 for The Troubleshooter**: Wide draw in a 1000m sprint is a genuine negative, requiring early tactical speed
