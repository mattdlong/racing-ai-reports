## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Alpha Sofie has the clear best figures - 1:02.59 for 1100m at Caulfield in Kev Hayes first-up win is outstanding for this field. No other runner comes within 3L on raw time.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Nashville Jack (4), Trapper John, and La Astro Chat likely forward. Suits on-pace and stalkers. Alpha Sofie can sit midfield and finish strongly.
**Class**: Massive class lift for most runners. Alpha Sofie the only runner with Group-level form (Kev Hayes Stakes Listed). Toronado Queen, Layla, and Fundamental Nature stepping up sharply from provincial/country wins.
**Bias**: No significant bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. Neutral assessment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Toronado Queen** ($13 EW): Won by 3.75L fresh at Cranbourne BM64, the most decisive recent win in this field outside Alpha Sofie. Barrier 2 is a major asset in a 15-horse field at Flemington 1200m. Greg Eurell gelding has 100% place record (3/3). EW EV +5.6%. The class jump is significant but the inside draw and sprint style suit.

**Layla** ($17 EW): Won maiden by 5L at Cranbourne over this trip - the biggest winning margin of any runner's last start. Hayes-trained filly stepping sharply in class but drawn to get a nice run from barrier 10. Distance proven (2 starts, 1 win, 1 place at 1200m). STRONG EW VALUE at +22% EW EV with place specialist profile (score 5.95).

**Alpha Sofie** is the class horse but $2.25 offers no value (fair odds $3.12). Happy to watch or use in multi legs only.

## KEY RISKS

1. Alpha Sofie blows them away - she's clearly the best horse and may win by daylight regardless of price
2. Track condition may deteriorate to Soft with rain forecast - our EW picks untested on wet ground (Toronado Queen 0 soft starts, Layla 0 soft starts)
