## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Red Galaxy has the best speed figure (85) off a BM100 placing at Sandown last prep; Great Maximus (82) and Watersports (84) next best on recent progressive form.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No confirmed leaders; Watersports and Bons To Riches likely to settle forward. Stalkers and midfield runners should get a fair run.
**Class**: Red Galaxy is the only runner with proven BM100 form (2nd Sandown 1400m). Most others are rising sharply - Watersports from BM66, Bons To Riches from BM74, Inexorable from BM70.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (low confidence). Good 4 surface, no rail position specified. No significant advantage to any running style or barrier position.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#2 Red Galaxy** ($7.00 EW): The standout form reference is a 2nd in BM100 company at Sandown (1400m) last prep - comfortably the best race in this field. Resumes off 41 days with two strong jumpout wins. Greg Eurell has the horse well placed for a first-up tilt. Career 70% place rate makes him a strong EW proposition (place specialist score 1.82). Lachlan Neindorf is a capable jockey. At $7.00, there's +12% edge on win and +12.8% EW expected value.

**#6 Inexorable** ($12.00 EW): Won 3 straight last prep at BM64-70 level showing progressive improvement. Has proven 1400m form (2 wins from 5 starts at the distance). Grahame Begg is an astute trainer. The concern is first-up form (9th Flemington, 5th Caulfield) but the $12 price provides ample compensation. Career 75% place rate and a place specialist score of 3.13 make this an excellent EW play at +19.1% EW EV. Inside barrier (3) in small field is ideal.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Red Galaxy**: Resuming off 41 days - first-up record untested at metro BM90 level; 0/4 at Flemington
2. **Inexorable**: Poor first-up form (9th, 5th); massive class rise from BM70 to BM90
3. **General**: Watersports is clearly the most talented horse and could win easily if handling the class rise - the market has this right directionally but has over-bet the price

## EW VALUE SUMMARY

| # | Horse | Win EV | Place EV | EW EV | Specialist |
|---|-------|--------|----------|-------|------------|
| 2 | Red Galaxy | +12.0% | +13.5% | +12.8% | 1.82 (Strong) |
| 6 | Inexorable | +20.0% | +18.1% | +19.1% | 3.13 (Strong) |
