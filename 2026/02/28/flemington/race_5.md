## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Celui posted the fastest 1000m figure (56.76s BM94 Randwick), clear of this field on raw time. Bridal Waltz untested at 1000m but Group 2 1200m form translates.
**Pace**: FAST tempo expected - Perilous Fighter, Bridal Waltz, and Celui all show early speed. Genuine 1000m sprint with no sit-and-sprint option. Inside barriers (1, 2) advantaged.
**Class**: BM100 is below the Group level several runners have contested. Mcgaw (G3 Danehill winner) and Bridal Waltz (G2 Gilgai/McEwen placed) have class edge but both resuming from 100+ day breaks.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. No actionable bias adjustment.

## KEY CONTENDER NOTES

**#3 Celui ($3.30)** - Best current form (3 straight wins). Won BM94 at Randwick 1000m three weeks ago. Rising through grades impressively with Richard & Will Freedman. Barrier 9 is the key negative in a 1000m sprint - will need to be ridden forward. Fair odds ~$3.70 but market has him right.

**#4 Mcgaw ($3.10 FAV)** - G3 Danehill Stakes winner but hasn't raced in 118 days. Untested at 1000m (all 7 starts at 1100-1200m). Barrier 8 adds further concern. Market is pricing the talent, not the circumstances. Most overbet runner in the field - fair odds ~$4.55.

**#1 Bridal Waltz ($4.40)** - G2 placed sprinter returning from 125 days. Only 2 starts at 1000m. Barrier 1 is ideal and Moody/Melham combination is strong. Would need $5.50+ for value.

**#10 Perilous Fighter ($7.50)** - Last start VG Prelude winner at Flemington (1100m). Drops to 1000m. Barrier 2 suits. Inconsistent form pattern (5-8-1-7-4-1) makes him hard to trust. Fair odds ~$8.33.

## PLACE SPECIALIST FLAG

**#2 Midwest** - STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score 4.20). Career 71% place rate (24/34). 1000m specialist with 8 wins from 24 starts at the trip. At $13/$2.88 place, the place market may offer marginal interest but EW EV is -6.7%. Monitor for place-only if drifts to $15+.

## KEY RISKS

1. Two top contenders (Celui, Mcgaw) drawn wide (barriers 8-9) in a 1000m sprint - pace pressure and wide running likely
2. Both Bridal Waltz and Mcgaw resuming from 100+ day breaks with only jump-out prep - fitness unknown
3. Rain forecast may change track conditions - currently Good 4 but deterioration would disadvantage Mcgaw (0 heavy starts) and benefit Bridal Waltz (3/4 wins on soft)
