## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sneaky Sunrise posted 95.91s over 1600m at Flemington (BM84) and 96.42s winning at Caulfield - best time horse in the field by 2+ lengths. Ahha Ahha second best off that Caulfield 2nd (1.75L behind Sneaky Sunrise).

**Pace**: MODERATE shape likely. Astral Flame (bar 1) should roll forward and lead. Sneaky Sunrise tracks midfield with cover from bar 4. Ahha Ahha (bar 2) should settle handy. No genuine speed-on scenario - suits on-pace runners with a finishing kick.

**Class**: Sneaky Sunrise proven at BM84 with a win and a 2nd at this level. Ahha Ahha placed at BM84. Mometz (#5) and Hot Digity Boom (#7) rising from BM74 - class test. Astral Flame jumping from BM70 - biggest class rise in field.

**Bias**: Neutral bias at Flemington on Good 4 (LOW confidence). No adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Sneaky Sunrise** is the clear top-rated runner with the best speed figures in the field, proven at Flemington (2/8 including a 2nd at this class/distance) and coming off a dominant 1.75L BM84 win at Caulfield 3 weeks ago. The $4.00 price represents marginal value (+4% edge) but the form credentials are the strongest in the race. Barrier 4 ensures a smooth run in transit with cover. The Hayes stable is in strong form.

**Mometz** shapes as the best value play at $7.50. Peter Moody-trained 4yo is on a steep upward trajectory with back-to-back wins at BM70/BM74. The class rise to BM84 is the query, but the EW value is strong (+11.4% EW EV) via Path A. Wide barrier (9) in a 9-horse field is the main concern.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Sneaky Sunrise**: Marginal edge at $4.00 - needs to drift to be compelling WIN bet; 5th last two starts before the Caulfield win shows inconsistency
2. **Mometz**: Untested at BM84 level, wide barrier, and only 9 days between runs (back-up query)
3. **Ahha Ahha**: Market favourite at $3.30 but clear underlay (-20.8% edge) despite running 2nd to our top pick last start
4. **Astral Flame**: Biggest class rise (BM70 to BM84), one-run preparation, over-bet at $3.80
