## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Educated tops the speed figures (82) from a dominant Cranbourne win; Wintery close behind (80) with the fastest raw 1000m time (56.34s Pakenham) in this field. Headbanger's 8L maiden romp impressive but class untested.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. La Roux and Wintery likely lead or press; Educated can track from barrier 1. On-pace runners favoured at Flemington 1100m.
**Class**: Educated rises from BM64 provincial to BM78 metro - significant jump but wins were commanding. Wintery's Kev Hayes 2nd (Listed level) is the best class line. Headbanger and Gwen's Girl both rising sharply from maiden/BM64.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. Inside barriers marginally preferred at Flemington 1100m.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Wintery at $9.00 represents strong each-way value. Her 2nd in the Kev Hayes Stakes (beaten 1.5L) is the best form reference in the race - that was Listed class, well above this BM78. She ran the fastest 1000m time of any runner in this field (56.34s Pakenham) and her form pattern of 1-2-6-1-2 shows consistency. Barrier 3 is ideal at Flemington 1100m and her 70% place rate (7 from 10 starts) makes her a strong place specialist (score: 2.68). The EW EV of +26.9% is compelling. Educated is the class runner but is short enough at $3.40 that the value sits with Wintery at the price.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise for most runners creates uncertainty - only Wintery (via Kev Hayes) has tested this level
2. Rain forecast could shift track condition; Wintery has 0/1 on soft (no wins) vs all good track form
3. Educated unbeaten and could simply be well above this grade - if so, $3.40 is fair
