## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Apulia won Chester Manifold (G3) at Flemington 1600m in 96.71s carrying 58kg - the best time benchmark in this field. Enxuto ran 3rd in the same race (0.3L off).

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No dominant leader; Air Assault and Holymanz likely to press forward. Apulia can stalk from barrier 2 and dictate position. Suits on-pace runners.

**Class**: Group 2 level. Apulia has proven G2 credentials (Perth Cup winner). Birdman (King Town Stakes) and Onesmoothoperator (MV Cup) have Group form but question marks today. Enxuto consistently placed at this level without winning. Air Assault a class rise from SA provincial Cups.

**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Good 4 surface should play fair. No rail position data available.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Apulia is the standout contender with a dominant form sequence of four consecutive wins including a Chester Manifold (G3) at this track and distance. The 57-day break is the only concern but a jumpout on Feb 20 should have the horse fit enough. Drawn barrier 2, jockey Michael Dee can position perfectly from the start. The Hayes stable targets these autumn features and has the horse primed. At $3.90, the market is offering genuine value against a horse with a 30% win probability - the +17% edge is strong with the confidence interval entirely positive (+5.3% to +28.7%).

## KEY RISKS

1. First-up off 57 days - only a jumpout for fitness; may lack peak race sharpness
2. No prior starts at 1600m - all wins at longer distances (1800-2400m) or shorter (1100-1496m); the mile is untested territory beyond the Chester Manifold win

## GREEN LIGHTS

1. Won Chester Manifold (G3) at this track/distance - proven course/distance form
2. 4 consecutive wins (VOBIS Gold Star, Chester Manifold, E Van Heemst, Perth Cup)
3. Barrier 2 with Michael Dee - ideal tactical position
4. 100% expert support (3/3 sources tip Apulia)
