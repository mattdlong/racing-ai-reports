| 9 | Onavuitton | 8 | $31 | Maiden | 6-3-x-1-4 | OK | Zahra/Stockdale | PASS |
| 10 | Express Class | 1 | $51 | Listed (Vain) | 3-6-x-9-6-7 | POOR | G.Moloney/P.Moloney | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Observer holds the best figures - VIC Derby (G1) and Autumn Stakes (Listed) wins. Sixties won CS Hayes impressively (1.25L margin). Both significantly superior to the BM66 level.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No confirmed leader; Observer and Planet Red likely settle midfield. Sixties may go forward from wide gate. Suits on-pace runners with tactical speed.

**Class**: Extraordinary class compression. Observer (VIC Derby G1 winner), Sixties (CS Hayes G3 winner), Planet Red (Caulfield Guineas 2nd) all dropping to BM66 - multiple grades below peak. Market has priced this accordingly with Observer $2.10 and Sixties $3.00.

**Bias**: Neutral (LOW confidence). No significant barrier or style bias detected on current Good 4 surface. Rain forecast may shift conditions.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Victorious Spirit** (#8) qualifies as EW VALUE via Path B (Place Specialist). Perfect 4/4 place record (100% place consistency, specialist score 10.4). Ran 3rd in the Autumn Stakes behind Observer and Planet Red - proven at this level. First time at Flemington and untested at 1600m are concerns, but the 1411m Sale maiden win and progression through the grades suggest the trip is manageable. At $23/$3.60 place, the EW return compensates for the uncertainty.

No WIN bet recommended. Observer is clearly the most likely winner (~38%) but $2.10 represents -20.2% edge. Sixties at $3.00 is worse value (-34.0%). Planet Red at $5.50 is nearly fair but no margin for error.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Rain factor**: Conditions may deteriorate from Good 4. Observer untested on wet; Victorious Spirit has place form on soft/heavy (3/3 place on rain-affected)
2. **First Flemington 1600m**: Victorious Spirit untested at track/distance; the straight can be demanding for lightly-raced types

## PLACE SPECIALIST NOTE

- **Planet Red**: 83.3% place rate (5/6), specialist score 1.93 - STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST. At $1.40 place, no value.
- **Victorious Spirit**: 100% place rate (4/4), specialist score 10.4 - STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST. At $3.60 place, borderline value.
