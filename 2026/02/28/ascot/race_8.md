*Dominatus PASS on value despite being top-rated - $2.50 is too short (fair odds $3.12).

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Dominatus holds the best figure (est. 88) off his 1600m Ascot CL1 win (100.90s). Dark Ambition improving rapidly with est. 76 off only 3 starts.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No confirmed leaders; Dominatus and Dark Ambition both raced on-pace recently. Should suit runners in the first half.
**Class**: CL1 level. Dominatus proven winner at this class/distance. Dark Ambition rising from maiden/restricted wins but did beat older horses at Belmont last start.
**Bias**: Soft 5 track, neutral bias (LOW confidence). Dark Ambition's barrier 10 is a minor negative. No tested soft track form is a concern.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Dark Ambition** is the value play at $15. Won his last two in progressive fashion (1300m Belmont by 0.11L, 1000m Belmont by 0.5L) and is trained by Simon Miller who excels with progressive 3yos. The 1600m is an untested distance but his closing style and 1300m/1400m form suggest he'll handle it. At $15 he offers genuine each-way value with a place specialist score of 3.47 and EW EV of +18.2%. The Crimson Pirate is the obvious place danger with 88% career place rate but offers no win value at $4.40.

## KEY RISKS

1. Dark Ambition untested at 1600m and on Soft ground - both unknowns
2. Wide barrier (10) in an 11-runner field on a Soft track could be costly
3. Dominatus is the clear class horse - if he runs to his best, others are racing for minors

## EACH-WAY ASSESSMENT

| Horse | Win EV | Place EV | EW EV | Place% | Specialist | Verdict |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| Dark Ambition | +20.0% | +16.4% | +18.2% | 25.9% | 3.47 | **STRONG EW** |
| Crimson Pirate | -12.0% | +5.0% | -3.5% | 56.8% | 1.82 | Place only |
| Aberdeen Flyer | -25.0% | -16.0% | -20.5% | 42.0% | 1.67 | No value |
| Linchpin | -22.0% | -18.6% | -20.3% | 36.2% | N/A | No value |
