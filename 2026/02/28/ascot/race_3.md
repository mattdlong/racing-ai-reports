# Ascot R3 | 1000m BM66
Sat 28 Feb | 4:04pm | 10r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**VALUE: #1 MILITARY POWER @ $26.00 - 1.6u EW**

Snow God will likely win but is a -40% underlay at $2.00. No win bet value in this race. Military Power offers EW value at huge odds with proven wet track form.

*Snow God PASS on value (best horse but -40% underlay at $2.00)

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Snow God holds the best figure (~88) with a 4-5pt margin over the field. Cannykev next best (~86) but untested on soft.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No genuine leaders in the field; Snow God and Excess Baggage likely to press forward. Should suit on-pace types.
**Class**: Snow God rising to BM66 after winning Westspeed Plat and trialling impressively. Earth God and Military Power have BM66+ experience. Cannykev stepping up sharply from CL1.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain is the key variable - eliminates several contenders.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Military Power at $26 each-way is the value play. His wet track record is outstanding: 4 wins/places from 14 starts on soft/heavy, including a win on heavy at Belmont. The 6yo is proven at the 1000m distance (7 wins from 26 starts) and gets barrier 3. His last two runs (7th, 5th) were both on Good tracks where he's less effective. The return to Soft 5 is a significant positive. At $26/$5.25, the place odds alone offer value given his 62% career place rate (place specialist score: 3.23). EW EV is +120.6%.

## KEY RISKS

1. Military Power's recent form is moderate (7th, 5th) and he's never won at Ascot (0/5)
2. Snow God is clearly the best horse and may dominate regardless of the soft ground
