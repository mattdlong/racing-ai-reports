## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Asif posted fastest 1600m figure (97.20s last start win). Stylish Lord ran 95.67s 2nd at same C/D in higher grade (RTG 72+), superior raw figure. Fancy Red's 97.20s was a 2nd, 0.35L off Asif.
**Pace**: MODERATE - small field of 8 with no confirmed leader. Asif and Fancy Red raced prominently last start. Expect even tempo suits midfield runners.
**Class**: Stylish Lord drops from RTG 72+ (higher than BM78 equivalent); Asif and Fancy Red rise from RTG 66+ to BM78. Class rise is the key question for the favoured pair.
**Bias**: Neutral (LOW confidence). Soft 5 track will test several runners' wet credentials.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No bet recommended. Fancy Red (#2) is the deserved favourite with Pike up, 86% career placing rate, and a proven heavy track win, but $1.90 represents -27.8% underlay - the market has fully priced in her superiority. Stylish Lord (#5) is the most interesting runner at $6.00 as a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score 1.63) with the best C&D record in the field (4 wins from 20 Ascot starts), but the -10% edge means no bet. Royal Law (#3) at $13 is the only runner showing marginal positive edge (+4%) but 97 days off and 0/6 on soft makes this too risky.

## KEY RISKS

1. Soft 5 track is a genuine concern - Asif (0/4), Royal Law (0/6), and Deamber (0/7) have poor wet records
2. Fancy Red rising from RTG 66+ to BM78 for the first time - $1.90 leaves no margin for class query

## PLACE SPECIALIST NOTES

- **Stylish Lord (#5)**: Place specialist score 1.63 (STRONG). Career 59% placing rate vs 36% expected. Best EW horse IF odds drift to $8+.
- **Royal Law (#3)**: Place specialist score 2.20 (STRONG) at lower win probability. Career 42% placing but wet track query.
