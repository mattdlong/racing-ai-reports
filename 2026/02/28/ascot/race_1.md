## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Stern Empire clocked 58.69s at Ascot 1000m (race-day) - 4+ seconds faster than any trial time in this field. Only horse with proven race-pace ability at the distance.
**Pace**: MODERATE - several first-starters and trial winners likely to settle, with #3 and #8 prominent early. Suits on-pace types with tactical speed.
**Class**: All 2YO maiden - level playing field. 7 of 11 are debutants making this highly speculative. Only #1 (5 starts) and #7 (2 starts) have meaningful race experience.
**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain - no firm bias data (LOW confidence). Wet track untested for almost all runners. Inner barriers marginally preferred on rain-affected tracks.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Stern Empire** (#7) is the only horse with genuine race-day form at Ascot over 1000m. Finished 2nd beaten just 0.25L in 58.69s, a time 4+ seconds faster than any trial in this field. While that was on Good ground and today is Soft 5, the time gap is enormous. Barrier 3 is ideal on a wet track and Chris Parnham is a solid booking. At $5.00 this represents fair value in a race full of unknowns.

**Gaintree** (#10) is a speculative EW play at $12. While only trialled 9th, the Simon Miller stable is capable with debutants, and $12 provides enough margin for a 2YO maiden lottery. Place odds of $3.00 with ~27% place probability gives marginal EW value (+10.6% EW EV).

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft 5 / Rain** - No runner has wet-track form. Stern Empire's fast time was on Good ground - significant unknown on Soft 5.
2. **Debutant lottery** - 7 of 11 are first-starters. Any of the Pike (#3), B Parnham (#8), or Parnham (#4) mounts could show ability well above trial form on race day.
3. **Wide barrier #3** - Afireofgidgeecoals draws barrier 10 which mitigates its ability; however William Pike can overcome this.

## EACH-WAY ASSESSMENT

| Horse | Win Odds | Win% | Place% | EW EV | Rating |
|-------|----------|------|--------|-------|--------|
| Stern Empire | $5.00 | 20% | 53% | +3.0% | MARGINAL |
| Gaintree | $12.00 | 10% | 27% | +10.6% | STRONG EW |

## CAVEATS

- **Data quality: MEDIUM** - Limited form data for most runners (debutants). No sectional times available. Expert tips sourced from 1 source only.
- Prize money ($738) suggests this is a very low-grade maiden - results will be highly variable.
- Speed figures are estimated from winning times only (no par-based adjustment available).
