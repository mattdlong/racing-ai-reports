## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Lien Hyphen posted the best recent figure winning Ascot 1800m CL3 by 2.23L (110.11s); Classic Impact and Southern Firetail close behind from same Ascot 1800m form lines (109.3s shared race).
**Pace**: MODERATE - no confirmed leaders drawn to dominate, suits on-pace and midfield runners. Lien Hyphen and Rosie Can Run both raced prominently in the CL3 1800m.
**Class**: Lien Hyphen won CL3 dominantly, rising to BM66 - justified on margin of victory. Southern Firetail stepping from Grad Hcp 58+ to BM66 (class rise). Classic Impact has strongest C/D form (2nd, 3rd at Ascot 1800m).
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence) - no significant track pattern to exploit.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Lien Hyphen is the value play at $8.00 based on a dominant last-start Ascot 1800m win by 2.23L in CL3 grade. She clocked 110.11s carrying 56.5kg which translates to the best speed figure in this field. The rise from CL3 to BM66 is manageable given the margin of victory. EW value qualifies via Path B as a Place Specialist (score 1.50, career 44% place rate). The market favourite Southern Firetail ($2.80) has ZERO soft track starts - at those odds, that's an unacceptable unknown. Classic Impact ($4.80) also has 0/5 on soft. This creates a soft-track value displacement toward runners with proven wet form.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Barrier 12** - widest draw in 12-horse field at 1800m; will need to be ridden cold and come wide or burn energy forward
2. **Soft 5 track** - Lien Hyphen has 0 wins from 6 soft starts (2 places); however this is better than the favoured pair (Southern Firetail 0/0, Classic Impact 0/5)
