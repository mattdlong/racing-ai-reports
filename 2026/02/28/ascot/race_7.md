## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Magical Sequence has the best raw figures winning Ascot 1200m in 71.04s two starts back; Later Alligator next best from 69.89s Ascot 1200m win. Bird's The Word won the same Ascot 1200m race in 69.83s.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - Boab Boy and Magical Sequence likely to press forward, suit on-pace and one-off runners. Bird's The Word and Spank Appeal both effective from midfield.
**Class**: Magical Sequence rising sharply from CL3 to BM66 at just 4th start this prep. Spank Appeal rising from CL1 but lightly raced with upside. Bird's The Word proven at this level.
**Bias**: Soft 5 track is the key variable. Neutral bias expected but wet track form critical.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Bird's The Word** (EW) won the Ascot 1200m Westspeed Platinum two starts back in 69.83s, beating Later Alligator and Leniency. Steps to 1400m where she has won previously (1/7 at distance). Critically, has 2 heavy track wins from 3 starts (67% wet heavy strike rate) and 3/19 on soft/heavy combined - handles the sting in the ground better than most. At $18, the edge calc shows +44% value. Place specialist score 2.67 with 45% career place rate. EW EV of +27.1% is strong.

**Spank Appeal** (EW) is a lightly raced 4yo with 2 wins and 5 placings from just 7 starts (71% place rate, specialist score 4.86). Won on soft at Bunbury by 2L, so handles the ground. From barrier 3 with Daniel Morton training in strong form. The class rise from CL1 is a query but only has 7 starts - upside is significant. At $21, edge is +47% with EW EV of +39.5%.

**Magical Sequence** is the obvious horse with Pike up, but at $2.15 in a BM66 with 15 runners on a Soft 5, she's significantly overbet. Fair odds ~$3.12. No value at current price despite being the most likely winner.

## KEY RISKS

1. Soft 5 track is the dominant factor - Bird's The Word handles it, but Spank Appeal has only 1 soft start
2. Both selections are at longer odds in a 15-runner field - volatility is high
3. Magical Sequence may simply be too good for this field despite the price
