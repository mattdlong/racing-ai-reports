## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: King Adviso posted competitive 1200m times on Soft/Heavy (72.28-74.85s) with proven finishing power; field lacks standout speed figures on rain-affected ground.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected with Snippy Which and Urquharts Bluff likely to press forward from low draws; King Adviso can stalk from midfield, suits his pattern.
**Class**: King Adviso drops from RTG 70+ to BM66 after winning and placing at higher levels through winter; has 6 wins from 22 starts (27% strike rate).
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected on Soft 5 with rain; inside barriers marginally advantaged but no strong pattern. Low confidence in bias data.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

King Adviso is the standout wet-tracker in this field with 3 wins and 5 places from 8 starts on Soft/Heavy (38% win rate, 100% place rate on give in ground). He drops in class after a strong winter campaign where he won 4 of his last 6 starts. Coming off a fresh trial 2nd at Belmont (0.39L behind winner over 1000m), he's race-fit without being exposed. At $6.50 in conditions that dramatically suit, he offers +30% edge with EW EV of +31.7%. Strong place specialist score of 1.70 supports the each-way approach. Brad Parnham is a capable booking from barrier 7.

## EW VALUE

- Place prob: 56.2% | Place specialist: 1.70 (STRONG)
- EW EV: +31.7% | Win EV: +30.0% | Place EV: +33.4%
- Place odds: $2.05 | Rating: STRONG EW VALUE

## KEY RISKS

1. 146 days between last race start and trial - fitness query despite trial (mitigated by strong trial 2nd)
2. Barrier 7 in an 11-horse field could mean wide passage if pace is slow and runners bunch

## MARKET WATCH

- **#10 Malletier** ($3.70): Short favourite with Pike aboard but UNTESTED at 1200m (all form at 1000m), no Soft form (0/2), and wide barrier 10. Fair odds $5.56, significant underlay at -33%.
- **#5 Rock 'N' The Jam** ($4.40): Talented but 384 days between starts, zero Soft/Heavy experience, untested at 1200m. Too many unknowns at this price.
- **#11 Urquharts Bluff** ($7.50): Strong Ascot C/D record but 0 wins from 2 Soft and 0 from 1 Heavy start. Place specialist (3.16 score) but lacks wet form.
