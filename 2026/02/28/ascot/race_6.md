## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Amaroo Star has the best raw figures (92) but is untested on Soft 5 with 0/5 record. Haida Gwaii (88) is the next best with proven wet ability.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Several on-pace types (Haida Gwaii, Amaroo Star, Sinful Living) but no extreme speed. Inside gates favoured - Avoidance (1), Sunny Honey (2), Haida Gwaii (3) all well positioned.
**Class**: Haida Gwaii rising from RTG66+ after dominant recent wins (7/13 career, 54% strike rate). Class rise is justified by trajectory. Amaroo Star has the class edge on dry but is severely compromised on soft.
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected but soft conditions typically favour inside runners and on-pace types. No prior meeting data to quantify.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Haida Gwaii** is the standout play at $5.00. A 7-win, 54% strike rate sprinter with dominant recent form (1-x-1-1-3-1), including a last-start win at this track/distance. Crucially, handles wet ground (1/2 soft, 1/1 heavy) while the $2.90 favourite Amaroo Star has a catastrophic 0/5 soft record with zero placings. With barrier 3 and Brad Parnham aboard, Haida Gwaii gets all the favours in the run. Fair odds $3.57 vs $5.00 available = +40% edge.

**Sunny Honey** and **Avoidance** at $20-21 offer enormous each-way value as wet track improvers drawn inside. Sunny Honey (2/14 soft, 1/4 heavy) is a proven wet tracker with barrier 2. Avoidance has a 50% win rate on soft (2/4) and draws barrier 1. Both are overlaid by the market.

## KEY RISKS

1. Haida Gwaii has only 2 starts on soft - small sample despite positive results
2. If the track dries out to Good 4 range, Amaroo Star becomes very dangerous
3. Sunny Honey and Avoidance are lower-class runners stepping up - form may not be strong enough
