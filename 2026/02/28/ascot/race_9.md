## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Hubble's Dragon has the superior speed ratings from recent wins but all at 1000-1200m; untested at 1400m. So Nataya won at Ascot 1400m (84.99s) which is the best C/D speed reference in this field.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No genuine leaders identified; likely a slow pace that brings the race back to on-pacers. Barrier 1 (King Hit) and barrier 4 (So Nataya) draw to get economical runs.
**Class**: BM72 metro. Hubble's Dragon rising sharply from CL1 provincial - 3+ class levels, significant red flag. So Nataya has won at CL3 Ascot 1400m, steady progression. King Hit won CL3 at 1400m on soft.
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain - track may deteriorate further to Soft 6/7 during the day, which would further disadvantage the untested Hubble's Dragon.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**So Nataya** (#12, $12 EW): Proven Ascot 1400m winner with 2 course wins from 6 starts. Good barrier (4) to get a soft run in transit. Place consistency of 76.5% (career 13/17 in top 3) makes her a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score 3.64). EW EV +13.7%. While soft track form reads 0/3, she has won on heavy (1/2) suggesting she handles give in the ground. Rising through the grades steadily.

**King Hit** (#11, $14 EW): Barrier 1 is a significant advantage in a 13-runner field on a soft track - gets the rails run and saves ground. Has 3 wins from 8 starts at 1400m, proving the distance affinity. Won on soft at Bunbury (1400m, CL3). Second at Ascot 1200m two starts back shows he's competitive at this level. Edge +26% represents genuine value at the price.

## AGAINST THE FAVOURITE

**Hubble's Dragon** (#7, $1.95) is the clear class horse with William Pike aboard, but is facing multiple unknowns simultaneously: first time at 1400m, first time on soft ground, first time at BM72 (jumping from CL1). His fair odds are $2.50 - at $1.95 he's a clear underlay (-22%). Career record of 0 starts on soft is the biggest concern with a Soft 5 track and rain forecast. Even elite 3yos can struggle when facing this many first-time challenges at once.

## KEY RISKS

1. Hubble's Dragon may simply be too good regardless of unknowns - Pike factor hard to quantify
2. Soft 5 track may deteriorate further, compounding wet-track unknowns for all selections
3. So Nataya's 0/3 soft track record is a concern despite heavy track win
