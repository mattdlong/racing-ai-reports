## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Wonderfully Made posted dominant 4.54L win at 1600m (98.37s) - clearly the best time figure in the field. Masmelo's 4.8L maiden win at 1800m Ascot (110.75s) is slower but distance-proven.
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected. No genuine leaders; Monte Tremezzo and Masmelo likely to position forward. Wonderfully Made settles midfield and should have the tactical speed to be where Pike wants.
**Class**: Wonderfully Made (CL1 winner) dropping significantly into CL5 - enormous class edge. Masmelo (CL3 3rd) also above this level. Rest are maiden/low class winners.
**Bias**: Soft 5 track with LOW confidence on bias data. No significant style or barrier bias detected. Soft track is a query for several runners with no wet form.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Wonderfully Made is the clear top-rater with a massive class edge (CL1 winner into CL5) and William Pike aboard. The 4.54L demolition at Belmont 1600m two starts back was outstanding. However, at $1.70 the price sits below fair odds of $1.82 - a 6.5% underlay. Two key risks cloud the picture: first start at 1800m (though the way she finished off at 1600m suggests the trip is no issue) and untested on Soft 5 (0 starts on soft). In a seven-horse field with this class advantage, she should win, but the price doesn't compensate for the unknowns.

Masmelo is the logical danger - the only horse proven at 1800m at Ascot (emphatic 4.8L maiden win). Inside barrier on a soft track is ideal. But $4.50 implies ~22% when I assess her at ~20% - slight underlay.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wonderfully Made untested at 1800m and on Soft 5 - two unknowns at prohibitive odds
2. Small field (7 runners) means limited value extraction; market is tight
3. Monte Tremezzo is a strong place specialist (score 1.98) but stepping up 400m in distance with no soft form

## EW NOTES

- Monte Tremezzo (#1) qualifies as EW value via Path B (Place Specialist score 1.98) at $8/$2.88, but negative EW EV (-26.7%) makes this marginal at best
- Masmelo (#5) EW at $4.50: place EV +3.1% but overall EW EV -3.4% - not enough
- No actionable EW positions identified
