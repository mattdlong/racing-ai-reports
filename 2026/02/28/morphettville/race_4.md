## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Longer Route posted the best raw time (109.23s/1800m Morph) but at 0-66 level. Wild Winner clocked 96.23s/1600m at BM78 - superior class-adjusted figure.
**Pace**: MODERATE - no confirmed leaders in the field. Longer Route and Savsonic likely to roll forward. Suits mid-runners like Wild Winner and Imposing Suspect.
**Class**: Wild Winner drops from BM78 to BM70 - significant class relief. Andrew's Memory jumps from BM62 to BM70 - query. Longer Route rises from 0-66 win.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Rain forecast may shift conditions. No track bias edge.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Wild Winner** is the standout each-way play at $11. The 4yo mare has a remarkable 75% place rate (15 placings from 20 starts) and drops from two runs at BM78 level where she was beaten just 0.39L (7th of 9) and 1.69L (2nd of 5). At BM70 she gets significant class relief. Place specialist score of 2.23 (STRONG) confirms she consistently runs top 3. The $11 represents +54% edge with EW EV of +51.6% (Path A + B qualified). The key query is untested beyond 1600m, but her style suggests she will handle 1966m.

**Imposing Suspect** offers secondary EW value at $12. The 7yo is distance-proven (11 starts at ~2000m, 1 win) and comes off a win at Bordertown BM66. At BM70 he's at his level and barrier 3 is ideal. EW EV of +16.3%.

**Longer Route** is the most likely winner at 30% but $2.50 is far too short (fair odds $3.33). No value as a bet despite strong form trajectory.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wild Winner untested beyond 1600m - 1966m is a genuine step up in distance
2. Rain may deteriorate track - Wild Winner 0/5 on soft (though 5 places from 5 starts on soft)

## EW DETAIL

| Horse | Win EV | Place EV | EW EV | Place Prob | Specialist | Path |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|------------|------------|------|
| Wild Winner | +54.0% | +49.1% | +51.6% | 42.6% | 2.23 (STRONG) | A+B |
| Imposing Suspect | +20.0% | +12.5% | +16.3% | 30.0% | 1.00 | A |
