## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No race-day speed figures available. All debutants bar Farnace (2 starts, no figures of note).
**Pace**: UNKNOWN shape - 6 unraced 2YOs over 1000m, expect scramble for positions. Drawn inside runners (bar 1-3) have tactical edge.
**Class**: Thomas Farms 2YO Plate ($65k). All runners unrated. Super Wonder's 1.11L trial win at this course is the standout piece of form.
**Bias**: Neutral bias detected (LOW confidence). Good 4 surface with rain forecast - monitor for deterioration.

## RUNNER NOTES

**#2 Super Wonder** ($2.80) - Deserved favourite. Won 800m Morphettville trial by 1.11L in 47.46s, the best trial performance in the field. Jolly stable strong with juveniles. Toeroek rides. Barrier 3 ideal. The one to beat but $2.80 is fair price, not value.

**#4 Chica Astuta** ($3.70) - Stokes-trained filly. Won 1000m jump out, then 5th of 6 in Caulfield Heath trial (beaten 0.10L, tight finish). First start at the trip is a query but stable debut well. Close to market price.

**#1 Cyclotron** ($3.80) - McEvoy-trained gelding. Multiple jump outs with mixed results (2nd x3, 8th x1, 1st x1, 6th x1). Inconsistency in trials is a concern. Barrier 2 helps but needs to show more.

**#5 Crazyaboutzou** ($7.00) - Jolly stable second string. 2nd in 800m trial but beaten 6.77L by the winner. Significant gap to bridge on debut.

**#6 Harmonik** ($7.50) - Won 600m jump out, 3rd in 800m trial but 6.77L off winner. Minor stable, apprentice jockey. Outside barrier in small field less of an issue but form is thin.

**#3 Farnace** ($18.00) - Only runner with race starts (2: 4th, 6th). Fourth at Morphettville over 1050m (0.81L off winner) is modest. Drops to 1000m. Rail draw helps but outclassed on ability.

## KEY RISKS

1. All debutants (bar Farnace) - no race-day form to assess; trial/jump-out form unreliable
2. Rain forecast could shift track condition, altering the race dynamics for untested horses
