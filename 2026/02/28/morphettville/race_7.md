## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Streetcar Apollo posted the fastest recent 1400m figure (83.57s at M'ville Parks BM72), with Tapinforpar beaten just 0.16L in that same race. Texan Windstorm ran 84.71s for 2nd in BM72 at Morphettville two starts back.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Streetcar Apollo and Tapinforpar likely to sit on-pace from good barriers. No genuine leader in the field should produce a genuine tempo without being suicidal.
**Class**: Streetcar Apollo rising from BM72 to BM74 off consecutive wins - the class test is modest. Placo, Watadeel and Exalted Fire have all competed at BM76-78 level previously.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). No significant rail or style advantages detected at Morphettville on Good 4.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Texan Windstorm** (EW) qualifies via Place Specialist Path B at $9.50. With 34 placings from 57 career starts (60% place rate), a specialist score of 2.13, and outstanding course/distance credentials (5 wins, 4 at 1400m from 19/20 starts), he profiles as a strong place contender. His 2nd in BM72 at Morphettville (31 Jan) was a solid effort beaten 1.9L, and the jump to BM74 is manageable. The wide barrier 6 is mid-field in a 7-runner field. At $9.50 EW (place odds ~$3.12), the 34% place probability generates +6.3% place EV.

**Streetcar Apollo** is the most likely winner but at $2.50 represents a 12.5% underlay (fair odds $2.86). Three wins from four starts this prep is outstanding, but the price doesn't compensate for the class rise risk.

## KEY RISKS

1. Streetcar Apollo dominant - if he leads and kicks, the place frame is compressed with only 3 paying positions in a 7-runner field
2. Texan Windstorm's inconsistency - 11th of 14 two starts back in the same race Streetcar Apollo won
