## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figures available. Joviale posted competitive times winning last two (92.69s/1508m Gawler, 101.44s/1600m Strathalbyn). Right Of Veto's 84.41s/1350m Strathalbyn also solid.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Multiple on-pacers (#7, #9, #10) should ensure genuine tempo. Mid-field runners with strong finishes favoured. Joviale's back-to-back wins suggest adaptable running style.
**Class**: Significant class rises for several contenders. Crespiano (MDN to BM64) and Midlife Crisis (MDN to BM64) face steep tests. Right Of Veto (CL2) and Rousing Refrain (CL1) also stepping up. Katim's Club is the most experienced at this level.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. Rain forecast could shift conditions - Katim's Club (1/12 soft) and Shakespeare (4/23 soft) have wet track form if it deteriorates.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Joviale is the selection based on progressive form trajectory - back-to-back wins including a dominant 2.7L victory at Gawler and a 1.3L win stepping up in trip at Strathalbyn. The 5yo has 2 wins from 5 starts at this distance range, suggesting the 1550m is within his compass. Barrier 6 is ideal in a 15-runner field. The $7 represents marginal value (+5% edge) but the upward form curve and inside draw give confidence. This is a minimum-stake play given the tight margins.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rising sharply in class from 0-56/CL1 to metro BM64 - untested at this level
2. Rain forecast could change track conditions - only 0/1 on soft tracks
3. Open, competitive 15-runner field makes any selection speculative

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

- **#3 Katim's Club**: Place specialist score 2.71x (57% career place rate vs 21% expected). 24 places from 42 starts. Consider place-only at $2.30 if available.
- **#7 Right Of Veto**: Place specialist score 1.70x (50% career place rate). Lightly raced, 4 from 6 in the placings.
