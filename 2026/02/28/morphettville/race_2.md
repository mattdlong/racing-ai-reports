## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited race time data. Ramasis ran 57.27s/1000m at Morph Parks (solid for maiden). Sicilian Princess timed 73.37s/1200m at Strathalbyn. Jumbo Jet trialled 65.7s/1050m. No clear speed standout.
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario likely. Several on-pacers (Ramasis, Sicilian Princess, Kikkuli) but no confirmed leader. Mid-field runners should get their chance.
**Class**: Weak CL1 field - majority are unraced or lightly-raced maidens. Only Aramoso (29 starts) and Sicilian Princess (8 starts) have meaningful race records. No proven winners in the field.
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. Good 4 track with rain - watch for deterioration.

## CONTENDER NOTES

**#8 Ramasis** ($2.50 fav) - 1 start for 2nd (0.68L) at Morph Parks 1000m. Three jumpout wins suggest above-average ability. Travis Doudle/Will Price combination. Barrier 3 ideal. The $2.50 price implies 40% win probability (market %) but my assessment is ~32%. Untested at 1250m is the key query. Too short at current odds.

**#13 Sicilian Princess** ($3.70) - Most experienced contender with 8 starts, 3 placings. Consistent 2nd placings at Strathalbyn 1200m (0.41L off winner) and Balaklava 1200m (0.37L). Richard & Chantelle Jolly stable. However, beaten 6.29L last start at Gawler and 5th of 10 two starts back. Inconsistent. Fair odds ~$5.00.

**#6 Jumbo Jet** ($4.40) - Debut runner from Phillip Stokes (elite stable). 2nd in 1050m trial at Morphettville (1.27L off No Bail who won that trial). Stokes debutants demand respect but zero race experience in a 13-runner field is a significant risk. No value at $4.40.

**#14 Thundara** ($9.00) - Raced once (4th at Tauranga NZ, 1400m). Trialled 4th at Morphettville 1050m. Aaron Bain stable. 56 days between runs. Limited evidence. Fair odds ~$11.

## PLACE SPECIALIST NOTE

**#1 Aramoso** - 29 starts, 0 wins, 13 places (45% place rate). Place Specialist Score: 7.1x (STRONG). However, barrier 13 in a 13-runner field is a significant negative, and $4.50 place odds don't compensate for 10.8% estimated place probability. Chronic maiden - avoid.

## KEY RISKS

1. Field dominated by unraced/lightly-raced runners - high uncertainty, low predictability
2. Rain forecast may change track condition during meeting (currently Good 4)
3. Wide barriers (13, 15) significant in 1250m races at Morphettville
4. Market heavily concentrated on two runners (Ramasis + Sicilian Princess = ~67% of book)
