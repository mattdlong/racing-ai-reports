## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Dirty Old Town posted fastest recent time (98.59s/1600m at Morphettville, won CL2 by 0.37L) - superior raw ability on the clock. Uptown Monk's 75.37s/1200m Strathalbyn maiden win was against weak opposition.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. No genuine leader identified - Dirty Old Town likely to settle midfield with cover from barrier 2. Uptown Monk from gate 1 should box-seat. Mostly For Show widest in 8 may need to go forward.

**Class**: Dirty Old Town rising sharply from maiden win to CL2 win (98.59s at Morphettville over 1600m against 14 runners) then into BM72 - trajectory is steep and progressive. Two wins from last three starts. Uptown Monk has only 2 career starts (maiden level) - massive class test jumping to BM72.

**Bias**: Neutral bias with LOW confidence. No significant track pattern to exploit.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Dirty Old Town is the clear value play at $6.50. She's won 2 of her last 3 including a CL2 at Morphettville over 1600m against 14 runners (98.59s), and her maiden win at Murray Bridge over 1400m (83.40s, won by 1.53L) shows distance aptitude. Career record of 2 wins and 4 placings from 5 starts (80% place rate) makes her a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (1.667 score). Inside barrier 2 with Jason Holder suits a covered midfield run. The market has her at $6.50 while fair odds are $5.00 - that's a 30% overlay. EW at 1/4 odds returns strong EV (+33.9%).

Safe Bet at $15 is the roughie EW play. Extraordinary place specialist score (3.125) with 60% place rate from 10 starts despite only 10% win rate. Ran 4th of 7 last start in this grade (BM72, 1250m) - close up 2.67L. Won at BM68 level over 1600m. Inside barrier 3 suits.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#4 Dirty Old Town** - Path A qualified: Odds $6.50 >= $6, EW_EV +33.9% >= +5%, Place prob 58.0% >= 30%. STRONG EW VALUE.

**#5 Safe Bet** - Path B qualified: Odds $15 >= $8, Place Specialist 3.13 >= 1.3. STRONG EW VALUE.

## KEY RISKS

1. Dirty Old Town untested on Good 4 (all 5 starts on Good, but rain forecast could shift conditions)
2. Uptown Monk is a potential star - only 2 starts, won maiden by 4.33L, Will Clarken stable in strong form
3. Dirty Old Town's 1400m experience limited to one maiden win - the step back from 1600m could suit or flatten her late
