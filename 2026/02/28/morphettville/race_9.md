## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Effusiv has the best raw time (56.89s 1000m M'ville Parks, 2nd), but most contenders clustered within 1-2L on the clock. No standout speed figure separates the field.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - several on-pace types (Shadow Eagle, Effusiv, Sharendipity) but none a dominant leader. Should be genuine speed without being suicidal. Mid-field runners can settle and finish.
**Class**: Significant class jumps for many runners. Effusiv, Shadowfax, Bangholme, and Smashing Action all stepping up sharply from BM56/0-62 to BM70. In Love ran 4th in BM72 last start - the best recent class exposure in the field.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). No significant style or barrier pattern detected at Morphettville on Good 4.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

In Love at $10 is the value play in a wide-open BM70 sprint. She ran a strong 4th in a higher-class BM72 at Morphettville Parks last start (0.45L from winner in 56.85s), giving her the best class credential in the field. She is a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score 2.706, 62.5% career place rate vs 23.1% expected) making EW the optimal bet type. While barrier 10 is a negative in a 1000m sprint, the genuine pace should allow mid-field runners to finish over the top. The $10 price offers +10% win edge with the EW providing additional insurance.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (10) in a 1000m sprint - needs luck from the draw
2. Rain forecast may change track condition - Good track record (3/18 wins) is adequate but not strong
3. Effusiv has the best draw (3) and trainer (Phillip Stokes) and could prove too strong if handling the class rise
