## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Nextonixs (85) and Mintulee (84) share the best speed figures from the BM72 1000m at M'ville Parks on 14 Feb where Mintulee won by 0.45L and Nextonixs ran 3rd. Daisydoo's best figure (82) comes from a BM66 win over 1050m.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Nextonixs (barrier 1) and Daisydoo should sit handy. Mintulee likely to settle midfield from barrier 10 and sprint late - proven closing style. No dominant leader suggests an honest tempo without extremes.

**Class**: Daisydoo makes a significant class rise from BM66 to BM78 (biggest jump in the field). Mintulee rises from BM72 - a smaller step. Nextonixs also steps up from BM72 but has run at higher levels before (BM72 metro). Cool Magnum and Brave Star have BM78 experience but are well past their best.

**Bias**: Neutral track bias expected on Good 4. No rail position data available. Rain forecast may soften the track during the meeting - Mintulee has a win on soft (BM74, 57.58s), Daisydoo handles wet (1/1 heavy, 1/4 soft).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Mintulee** represents the only genuine value play at $7.50 each-way. She shares the best speed figure in the race (84) from her BM72 win on 14 Feb at Morphettville Parks (56.85s), with proven course (4 wins from 11 starts) and distance (4 wins from 19 starts) credentials. The class rise from BM72 to BM78 is manageable, and the EW expected value is +12.5% (STRONG EW VALUE). Barrier 10 is the main concern in a 9-runner field but her midfield settling pattern mitigates this. The co-favourites Nextonixs and Daisydoo are both on the wrong side of value at $3.70 - Nextonixs has the raw ability but is tightly held in the market, while Daisydoo's class rise from BM66 is the biggest in the field.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Barrier 10** in a 9-runner 1000m sprint - needs luck from wide, may get back and need a clear run
2. **Class rise** from BM72 to BM78 - although smaller than Daisydoo's, still needs to prove at this level

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

- #6 Daisydoo: Score 1.67 (STRONG) - 80% career place rate vs 48% expected. Short price limits EW value.
- #10 Nicish: Score 2.20 (STRONG) - 58% career place rate vs 26% expected. 118-day layoff and distance query (prefers 1200m+) limit appeal.
