## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figures; open race on raw ability. Annihilate has the best form lines (3rd x2 in BM72), Royal Scripture won at this C/D in CL2.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No confirmed leaders; Scandalize (bar 1) and Royal Scripture (bar 2) can position cheaply. Stokomo (bar 9) will need luck.
**Class**: Annihilate dropping from BM72, but 0/14 at Morphettville is a major concern. Royal Scripture rising from CL2 win but lightly raced with upside. Talisay dropping from BM78 but 97 days off and 0/3 at 1400m.
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected on Good 4 (LOW confidence). Inside draws should have slight advantage in a 10-runner field.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Royal Scripture at $8.50 EW offers genuine value. Won at this course and distance (Morphettville Parks 1400m) on Boxing Day, beating a CL2 field by 0.1L. The 5th last start at Morphettville 1600m CL2 was only 0.37L off the winner in a 14-runner field - a solid effort at a new trip. Lightly raced 4yo (9 starts) with upside, ideal barrier 2 for cheap positioning, and the step to BM64 is manageable. EW EV of +8.2% with 36.8% place probability via Path A qualifies as Each-Way Value.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise from CL2 to BM64 - first test at this level
2. Rain forecast could shift track to Soft - only 2 soft starts (1W/1P) but small sample

## MARKET NOTES

- Stokomo ($4.40 fav) is a serial placer (71% place rate, specialist score 1.86) but poor win value at short odds. Fair odds ~$6.25.
- Scandalize ($6.50) is close to fair value and has the best draw. Near-miss in BM66 last start. Watch for drift.
- Annihilate ($5.00) is significantly under fair odds ($6.25). The 0/14 Morphettville record despite dropping in class makes this a poor bet.
- Hysterical Lady ($7.50) is the ultimate place specialist (86% place rate, score 2.98) but wide barrier 10 and 41 days off limit appeal.
