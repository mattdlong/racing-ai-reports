## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Autumn Frost (78) has the best figure, derived from a strong CL1 2nd at Gawler (71.46s/1207m) and a sharp Morphettville CL2 4th (69.55s/1200m). Big Brute (75) and Round Two (73) are next best but the gap is modest.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No dominant leader in the field. Autumn Frost and Round Two both race on-speed. Big Brute typically sits midfield. Without a hot tempo, on-pace runners should get a fair run.

**Class**: All competitive at BM56 level. Autumn Frost rises from CL1 win (1300m Morphettville Parks, Soft) - proven at this level. Round Two drops from BM64/66 (1050m) but stepping up to preferred 1250m distance. Big Brute won a BM56 last prep at Strathalbyn.

**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. Good 4 surface should be fair across barriers.

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

The market is efficient here. Autumn Frost at $2.90 is a legitimate favorite with the best figures, proven C/D form, and elite SA connections (R&C Jolly). However, there's a critical concern: **0 wins from 4 starts on Good ground** (all wins on Soft). With rain forecast but Good 4 currently, the surface is the key variable.

Round Two at $3.90 represents the closest to value - dropping in class from BM64/66 to BM56, stepping to preferred 1250m, and has a strong Morphettville record (2/8). But recent 1050m form (5th, 4th) is below par and 0/9 on Good ground is alarming.

Big Brute at $4.20 won a BM56 at 1200m last start but 0/7 at Morphettville course and wide barrier (9) in a moderate-tempo race hurts.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Autumn Frost Good track form**: 0/4 on Good - all wins on Soft. If rain doesn't arrive in time, the $2.90 is very short for a horse that has never won on this surface.
2. **Round Two fitness**: Coming back from 1050m to 1250m after two below-par runs at BM64+ level. The class drop helps but the form line is questionable.

*No bet recommended. Market is efficient with no identifiable edge. Monitor if track deteriorates to Soft - Autumn Frost becomes stronger at $2.90+ if the surface suits.*
