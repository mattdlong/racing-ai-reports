# Gosford R2 | 1100m Maiden Hcp
Wed 11 Feb | 1:25pm | 4r (7 scratched) | Soft 5

## ACTION

**NO BET** - All runners underlays. 127.7% market overround in 4-horse field offers zero value. Maiden debut runners add uncertainty without compensating price.

## FIELD ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Form | Class | Wet | Conn | Score | Tier |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|-------|-----|------|-------|------|
| 5 | Written In Wrath | 10 | 1.75 | Debut (trial 1st 4.75L) | 60 | Untested | Hot | 44.5 | WATCH |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No reliable speed figures available - maiden field with limited race history. Written In Wrath's trial win (4.75L at Randwick 1050m) is the standout piece of work but trial-to-race conversion is uncertain.
**Pace**: MODERATE - small field likely produces genuine tempo. Written In Wrath and Declan both showed early speed in trials. Sphere likely settles midfield.
**Class**: All runners at maiden level (60 rating). Written In Wrath debuting for Waterhouse/Bott carries the strongest class perception. Sphere for Waller has the most race experience (3 starts, 2 placings).
**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain - no track bias data available (LOW confidence). Written In Wrath and Declan both untested on soft. Sphere has placed on soft (1 placing from 2 soft starts).

## KEY RISKS

1. Written In Wrath ($1.75) is far too short for a debutant on an untested surface - trial form doesn't always translate, especially first-up on Soft 5
2. Only 4 runners with 127.7% overround makes finding value virtually impossible - all runners are underlays at current prices

## PLACE PROBABILITIES

| # | Horse | Win% | Place% | Place Odds | Place EV |
|---|-------|------|--------|------------|----------|
| 5 | Written In Wrath | 42% | 85% | - | - |
| 6 | Sphere | 26% | 69% | 1.88 | +10.4% |
| 1 | Declan | 24% | 68% | 2.00 | +12.2% |
| 10 | Olivia Twist | 8% | 19% | 3.60 | -31.2% |

*Note: Place-only EV is positive for Sphere and Declan but not sufficient to warrant EW bets at these win odds.*
