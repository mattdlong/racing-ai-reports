## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Showtime Shadow (72) edges the field on raw speed from his Wyong trial win in 59.46s over 1000m. Ness (70) close behind from Randwick trials. Thin margins across all runners - no standout figure.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Showtime Shadow and Ness both showed mid-pack racing styles in trials. No confirmed leaders makes pace prediction unreliable for a field of debutants/lightly-raced types.
**Class**: Weak CL2 - essentially maiden-class runners having their first or second race starts. Ness has the Les Bridge training edge but no race-day evidence yet. Showtime Shadow's 1.97L trial win is the best piece of form but at Wyong barrier trial level.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain - track likely to deteriorate further. Only The Netball Queen (3 starts soft, 1 place) has any meaningful wet track form.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No selection recommended. This is an extremely weak CL2 field comprising barrier trial graduates and maiden placegetters. Every runner is an underlay on current market odds. The Soft 5 track with ongoing rain adds further uncertainty - most of these runners are untested on soft/heavy ground. The favourite Ness ($2.60) shows -22% edge with fair odds of $3.33, making her particularly poor value despite the Les Bridge connection. Showtime Shadow at $3.50 is the closest to fair value (-12.5%) but still insufficient edge to justify a bet in such an unreliable race.

## KEY RISKS

1. Most runners untested on soft ground - track likely to deteriorate further with rain
2. Field dominated by barrier trial form with minimal race-day evidence - high variance expected

## PLACE PROBABILITIES

| 1 | Showtime Shadow | 25% | 64% | $1.33 |
| 8 | The Netball Queen | 18% | 45% | $1.50 |
| 5 | Three Wishes | 10% | 34% | $2.05 |
| 2 | Soho | 10% | 24% | $2.25 |
