# Gosford R4 | 1200m CL1
Wed 11 Feb | 1:25pm | 8r (4 scr) | Soft 5

## ACTION

**NO BET - All contenders underlay at current market odds (128.6% overround). Weak CL1 field of lightly-raced maidens/debutantes with insufficient form to establish reliable edge.**

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Insufficient timing data - all runners lightly raced with trial/maiden form only. No reliable speed figures can be generated from this field.
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario likely. Vision In A Dream (bar 1) and Kitesurfing (bar 4) can settle forward. No confirmed leaders, so pace should be honest without being suicidal.
**Class**: All runners at CL1 level (effective rating ~62). Field comprises maidens stepping into class, and debutantes. No class standout.
**Bias**: Soft 5 track with LOW bias confidence. Neutral style/barrier bias expected. Rail position not specified.

## CONTENDER NOTES

**#11 Vision In A Dream ($3.40)** - Debuting for Peter Snowden with Andrew Adkins aboard. Four barrier trials over 7 months (best: 3rd at Randwick 740m on soft, 4th WF 796m on soft). Barrier 1 is an asset in small field. Market confidence is strong but no race form to validate. Expert tipped (1/1 source). Fair odds ~$4.55 making her an underlay at $3.40.

**#3 Eynesbury ($4.50)** - Best recent race form in the field. 3rd at Canterbury 1250m on soft (0.51L behind Willingham) last start for Waller. Previously 2nd at Rosehill 900m trial. Steps up to 1200m for the first time at a race - the 1250m Canterbury run was encouraging. Siena Grima claims. Expert tipped (1/1 source). Closest to value but still underlay at $4.50 (fair ~$5.56).

**#8 Kitesurfing ($4.80)** - Ciaron Maher filly, 3rd Hawkesbury 1000m on soft in April '25 is best result. Recent runs disappointing (5th Kensington, 8th Canterbury). All 3 starts on soft - familiar with the going. But poor recent trajectory is concerning at $4.80.

**#4 Fabres ($6.50)** - Joseph Pride gelding coming off a 145-day break. Last start 3rd in barrier trial at WF. Previous race starts showed placed form at longer (3rd Wyong 1300m on soft). Freshened but unproven first-up.

## KEY RISKS

1. Debutante-heavy field creates extreme uncertainty - two first-starters (Vision In A Dream, Wiltshire Lass) make probability estimates unreliable
2. Soft 5 track with no rail position specified - conditions may deteriorate further, rewarding wet-track form that most runners lack
3. Market overround of 128.6% means all prices are compressed - no value available at current book
