## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout figure holder - Boss clocked 57.21s for 1000m at Muswellbrook (BM82 level, soft), best raw time in field; Dietrich 56.87s at Gosford 1000m but in maiden grade.
**Pace**: MODERATE - Better Late and Bondasong likely to push forward; suits on-pace runners who can sustain. Boss has tactical speed from midfield.
**Class**: Nearly every runner faces a significant class rise. Boss is the only runner who has won at BM82 level (Muswellbrook Sizzler). Better Late won BM58, Dietrich won MDN/BM64, Bondasong won maiden. Boss has the class edge.
**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain - favours wet trackers. Boss 2/9 on soft (22%), Bodgie 2/18 soft + 3/18 heavy but poor recent form. Gladstone Grande 0/0 on soft is a concern.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Boss at $10 represents the best value in a weak, open race where the market favourites are all significantly overbet relative to their class credentials. Boss is the only runner proven at BM82 level, winning the Muswellbrook Sizzler on soft ground just 28 days ago. His place specialist score of 1.625 (strong) via Path B qualifies him as each-way value. While he draws wide (10) and is 0/4 at Gosford, the 1100m suits as a distance compromise and the soft track plays to his strengths. The top 3 in market are all rising sharply in class from well below BM78 level, making this race more open than the market suggests.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (10) in an 11-horse field on rain-affected track - needs luck from out wide
2. 0 wins from 4 starts at Gosford; course form is a question mark
3. Kris Lees filly Wisnierska (bar 1) has class pedigree from QLD metro racing and the inside draw

| Boss | 42.9% (9/21) | 26.4% | 1.625 | STRONG |
