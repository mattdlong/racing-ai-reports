# Gosford R6 | 1200m BM64
Wed 11 Feb | 1:25pm | 8r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Market is tight with 127% overround. No win edge detected on any runner. Marginal EW value on favourite (#4) driven by place probability but insufficient for confident staking on Soft 5.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Harry's Evidence posted the fastest 1200m time (69.05s Wyong) but on a Good track - Soft 5 will slow the surface 2-3 seconds. Aligned clocked 71.05s at Newcastle BM64 level, consistent across runs.
**Pace**: MODERATE - no confirmed leaders, likely Aligned and Harry's Evidence settle on-pace from mid-field. Small field should produce genuine tempo without extremes.
**Class**: All runners are at or near the BM64 level. Harry's Evidence is rising sharply (maiden win Jul '25 to BM64), Aligned has been competitive at this level for 6 months without winning above maiden. Miss Fleetwood dropping from metro BM64 to provincial.
**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence, neutral bias assumed. Soft 5 with rain - may deteriorate further. Inside barriers 1-4 may hold an advantage if track worsens.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No selection recommended. Harry's Evidence is the deserved favourite with the best recent form (2 wins from last 3) but is too short at $2.70 given 0/3 on soft tracks and a steep class rise from maiden grade in 6 months. Aligned is the each-way alternative with a Gosford 1200m win on soft and consistent placings (50% career), but barrier 10 in an 8-runner field and a lack of recent wins (last win Jul '25) limit conviction. The Soft 5 track adds significant uncertainty - Harry's Evidence is unproven and Spaceballs (0/6 soft) is compromised.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft track uncertainty**: The favourite has no soft track wins (0/3) and the track may deteriorate further with rain - major unknown for the $2.70 price
2. **Small field compression**: Only 8 runners means less separation in ability, making upsets more likely and favourite reliability lower
3. **Class question**: Multiple runners rising in grade simultaneously (Harry's Evidence, Classic Pocket) with limited exposure to this level

## EW NOTES

- **Harry's Evidence**: EW EV +5.1% (place prob 85%), but $1.30 place odds offer negligible return
- **Aligned**: EW EV +2.2% marginal (place prob 65%), place EV +7.2%. Place specialist score 0.83 (NORMAL)
- **Spaceballs**: Place specialist score 1.39 but 0/6 on soft kills EW value
