## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited data - most runners are debutants or lightly raced. Scintillation's trial win (47.24s/800m Soft WF) and 2nd (46.52s/799m Heavy WF) are the best time references. Woodrow ran 58.3s/1000m Good Wyong (3rd) which is the only raceday 1000m benchmark.
**Pace**: MODERATE - several on-pace types (Scintillation, Woodrow, Perfect Force) but no dominant leader. Soft 5 track will take sting out of speed.
**Class**: Provincial maiden plate - low base class (58-62). Scintillation has metro trial form edge. Tigletta has most starts (4) with 100% place rate but from weaker fields.
**Bias**: Neutral bias reported with LOW confidence. Rail position not specified. Soft 5 with rain - inside barriers slight advantage if track deteriorates further.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No selection recommended. While Scintillation (#9) is the clear standout on ability - won a Warwick Farm trial, placed 2nd in another, trained by O'Shea/Charlton - the $1.95 price offers no value against our assessed 35% win probability (fair odds $2.86). This is a maiden race with high uncertainty (many debutants, soft track, limited form lines), yet the market is pricing Scintillation as though this is a formality.

**Tigletta (#7)** is notable as a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score 3.79) with 100% place rate from 4 starts, but even her place odds ($1.70) offer negative expected value at our assessed 36.4% place probability.

## KEY RISKS

1. Soft 5 track with rain - could deteriorate to Heavy, which dramatically reshuffles the form
2. Seven of nine runners are debutants or have fewer than 3 starts - massive uncertainty in true ability levels
