## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Fireforce has the best recent times - 2nd at Gold Coast 1400m (84.11s) and 2nd at Eagle Farm 1200m (70.84s), both in CL1 grade, comfortably above this BM55 level. Heavenly Impact has higher class exposure (CL6/BM68) but hasn't converted on soft ground (0/9 on soft).

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Only 2-3 genuine on-pacers in the field. Fireforce settles midfield and finishes strongly - suits a genuine tempo. The small field reduces pace pressure, benefiting those who can position without racing wide.

**Class**: Fireforce is the clear class dropper - racing in CL1 grade last two starts (including a narrow 2nd at Gold Coast), now back to BM55. Heavenly Impact has higher-class exposure (CL6/BM68) but hasn't been competitive enough to justify the $2.35 price. Data Scramble raced in BM68 as a 3YO but was well beaten.

**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain - track bias data is LOW confidence (neutral). Soft ground is a significant factor here: Fireforce won on soft (1/5), Heavenly Impact is 0/9 on soft (big red flag at short odds), Data Scramble is 1/6 on soft. Castello Grande is 1/3 on soft with all places coming on give in the ground.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Fireforce is the clear value play at $4.40. This is a class dropper from CL1 grade into BM55, coming off two consecutive 2nds at Gold Coast (1400m) and Eagle Farm (1200m) against stronger fields. The step up to 1350m at Doomben is within his range (3rd at Doomben 1350m in July). Kelly Schweida is a capable QLD trainer and barrier 3 is ideal in a small field on a rain-affected track. The EW value is strong at +16.1% EV with 66% place probability. The main risk is that his only Soft win came early in his career and his two most recent runs were both on Good ground - the Soft 5 today is an unknown, though soft-track form (1/5 with a place) isn't disqualifying.

**Why not Heavenly Impact at $2.35?** Despite being favourite, Heavenly Impact is 0 for 9 on soft ground with just 1 place. At $2.35, you need ~42% win probability to break even, and his wet form doesn't support that. He's a classic false favourite on the day's conditions. Data Scramble ($3.50) is also too short given inconsistent form and 1/6 soft record.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft 5 with further rain** - Fireforce's soft form is adequate (1/5 w/ place) but not proven; could deteriorate to Heavy during the day
2. **Wide runner Castello Grande** ($8.00) has the best wet-track conversion rate (1/3 soft, all places on give) and could run into a place from barrier 10 if luck permits - main threat to EW component
