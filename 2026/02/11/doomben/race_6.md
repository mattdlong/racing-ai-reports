## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Lovey Dovey has the strongest recent times (won 2190m Ipswich in 136.03s, won 2150m Ipswich in 133.58s). Techna competitive (3rd BM78 2200m Sunshine Coast in 136.4s). Bavarian Lady's times at lower levels are solid.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Lovey Dovey and Guarded Optimist likely on-pace. Whatjeudoin' and Demarcay stalkers. Bavarian Lady mid-pack. No extreme speed in field; on-pace runners have moderate advantage over 2240m on soft.

**Class**: Lovey Dovey rising from BM65 wins - warranted by form trajectory. Techna dropping from BM78 3rd (0.37L margin) - class advantage. Bavarian Lady rising from BM60 wins - biggest class query but form is red hot (3 wins last 6). Whatjeudoin' rising sharply from BM58 - biggest class jump.

**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain. Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Inside barriers have slight edge on rain-affected going. Soft track specialists Demarcay (3/21) and Guarded Optimist (4/13) have proven form on give.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Bavarian Lady** at $20 represents genuine each-way value. She has won 3 of her last 6 starts and is a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score 3.64, 46% career place rate vs 13% expected). The class rise to BM68 is the key risk, but her form trajectory is steeply upward (BM58 > BM60 > BM60 > BM70 close 3rd). EW EV is +33.2% with place odds of $4.75. The $20 price significantly overrates the class concern given her current momentum. Lovey Dovey is the most likely winner at 22% but the $4.80 offers only marginal edge (+5.6%) and is a WATCH only.

## KEY RISKS

1. Bavarian Lady: Class rise to metro BM68 - all 3 recent wins at BM60 or below at provincial/country level
2. Soft 5 with rain: Could deteriorate further; Bavarian Lady's soft record (2/18) is below her overall strike rate
3. Lovey Dovey: Wide barrier (10) over 2240m could cost ground on the soft; may be overbet as favourite
