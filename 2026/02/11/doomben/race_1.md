## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Paper Doll has the best figures from consistent 1200-1400m runs stepping to 1650m for the first time - untested at the trip. Abraham competitive at 1200m but also untested at 1650m. French Riviera ran 2nd at this track/distance (1650m Doomben, Soft) just 12 days ago, beaten 0.4L.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - small field with no genuine leaders. French Riviera and Abraham likely to stalk. Paper Doll should get a soft lead or sit handy from barrier 5.
**Class**: All runners are maidens stepping into CL1 or coming from maiden company. Equivalent class. Paper Doll (0/10), Abraham (0/5), French Riviera (0/12) - none have won a race.
**Bias**: No significant bias detected (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain - conditions suit French Riviera (4 places from 4 soft track starts) and Paper Doll (5/6 on soft).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

French Riviera represents the best each-way value at $7.00. She is a **STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST** (score 1.73) with 7 places from 12 starts (58%) and ran 2nd at this exact track and distance on Soft just 12 days ago, beaten only 0.4L. The EW EV is +11.5% with place EV at +25%. While Paper Doll is the most likely winner, she is a clear underlay at $1.75 (fair odds $2.13) with six consecutive 2nds and zero wins from 10 starts - a chronic placegetter who may again find one too good. The value lies in French Riviera's place component at $2.50.

## KEY RISKS

1. Paper Doll dominates - she is clearly the best horse and could win easily, pushing French Riviera out of place frame
2. French Riviera's 0 wins from 12 starts raises ceiling concerns - may lack the turn of foot to threaten on win leg
3. Soft 5 with rain could deteriorate to Heavy, untested conditions for several runners
