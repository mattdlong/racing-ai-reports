## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figures; Toro Chase's Ipswich 3rd (63.45s/1100m) and Eagle Farm 2nd (71.4s/1200m) rate best on adjusted times, 2-3pts ahead of Meadowbrook and Wiliamtheconqueror.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - Wiliamtheconqueror (bar 1) and Aristocratic Girl (bar 4) likely lead, Toro Chase can stalk from midfield which suits his closing pattern.
**Class**: CL3 with $3,700 prize money is low-grade metro. Toro Chase has the strongest class form (Eagle Farm maiden 2nd, Ipswich CL3 equivalent), Ciphertext has depth of metro placings despite maiden level.
**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain - no detected bias (LOW confidence). Inside barriers slightly preferred on wet Doomben tracks historically.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#4 Toro Chase** is the value play at $6.00 each-way. His 100% placing rate (4 from 4) makes him the standout place specialist (score 2.32). While he has 143 days off, his trial form (2nd at Deagon, 4th at Inner Track) shows readiness. He's placed at this track/distance before (3rd Doomben 1110m) and his Eagle Farm 2nd in 3Y maiden class rates strongly. The +8% win edge and +13.8% EW EV make him the clear value selection. Key concern is untested on soft ground (all 4 starts on good).

**#6 Ciphertext** qualifies as an EW longshot via Place Specialist Path B (score 3.65) and Longshot Path C. At $20 she offers massive overlay (+60% win edge) though win probability is only 8%. Her 70% career placing rate is extraordinary, and critically she has 6 placings from 7 starts on soft - this is her surface. The $20 is generous for a horse with her wet-track consistency. The 55.3% EW EV and 50.6% place EV make this a strong speculative play.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Toro Chase**: Zero soft-track form (all 4 starts on good) - untested on Soft 5 is the primary concern
2. **Wiliamtheconqueror**: Market favourite at $3.40 but 230-day spell, only trial win at Deagon, and no 1110m form - poor value despite inside draw
3. **Ciphertext**: Wide barrier 9 in 11-runner field, last start 11th of 14 at Gold Coast was a flop after winning trial
