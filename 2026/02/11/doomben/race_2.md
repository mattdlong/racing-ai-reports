## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figures in this maiden. #1 Artistic Endeavour has the best recent form (2-2-2 last 3 over distance) but times are modest.
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected. #1 likely leads or stalks, #7 sits midfield. No genuine speed in the field should produce an honest tempo.
**Class**: All runners are maidens with no class separation. This is a weak provincial maiden ($4,317 prize).
**Bias**: Neutral bias at Doomben, LOW confidence. Soft 5 track with rain - inside barriers slightly advantaged but not statistically significant.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No bet recommended. While #7 Katie Aine profiles as the most likely winner with recent Doomben Soft form (3rd by 0.09L, 12 days ago) and the Munce stable in good form, the $3.10 price implies 32% win probability which significantly exceeds our 24% assessment. The -25.6% edge makes this an underlay. #1 Artistic Endeavour has strong placings form (three 2nds) but is 0/4 on soft ground - a critical concern on a Soft 5 track with rain. #11 Weekend Spirit at $6.50 is the closest to value (edge CI touches breakeven) but insufficient confidence to act.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft track form**: The two market leaders (#1 and #7) have limited/poor soft track records - conditions suit none of the fancied runners convincingly
2. **Maiden race volatility**: 12 starts without a win (#1), lightly raced unknowns (#2, #7) - inherent unpredictability in weak maiden fields
3. **Market overround**: 126.8% market percentage inflates all prices but not enough to create genuine value at our assessed probabilities

## SCRATCHINGS

- #4 Hello Dolly Diva (scratched)
- #9 Lady Tangalooma (scratched)
- #12 Pronto Percy (scratched)
