## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Open race with no standout speed figure; Change The Date's BM82 Taree win (97.86s/1600m) is the class benchmark.
**Pace**: MODERATE - likely genuine tempo with several on-pace runners (#1, #6, #15) ensuring honest speed; suits midfield runners.
**Class**: Change The Date drops from BM82/BM74 to BM65 - significant class drop. Zou Big Boy competitive at CL3/BM70 level.
**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain - conditions will deteriorate further. Wet track specialists heavily advantaged.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#2 Change The Date** is the primary selection. Elite wet track record (3/6 heavy, 2/15 soft = 5/21 on rain-affected) with a genuine class drop from BM82 to BM65. Won at Taree 1600m and placed in BM74 company. Steps to 1650m which suits (1/4 at distance). At $8.00, the market is underestimating the wet track advantage - fair odds $6.67. Place specialist score 1.81 supports EW approach. Qualifies via Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist).

**#3 Zou Big Boy** is the secondary value play. Remarkable heavy track form (3/5 winners, all at 1600m+) for the Tony Gollan stable. While Soft 5 isn't Heavy, further rain forecast could push conditions closer to his sweet spot. At $13.00 with fair odds of $10.00, the +30% edge is substantial. First-up from a break but Gollan has this horse targeted at wet tracks. Place specialist score 2.95 (outstanding). Qualifies via Path B.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Change The Date**: First start at Doomben (0/1 prior), stepping up from NSW country circuit to metro - may find BM65 metro tougher than BM82 country
2. **Zou Big Boy**: Soft 5 may not be wet enough (0/4 on Soft vs 3/5 on Heavy); 26-day gap since last start; drawn barrier 4 but wide field could cause traffic
3. **Market favorite The Wheelbarrow** ($4.80) is untested at 1650m and the -4% edge suggests fair price at best - no value
