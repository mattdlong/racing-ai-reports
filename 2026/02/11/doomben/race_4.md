## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No sectional data available. Time-based assessment gives Trapedo best recent figures - won CL1 at Sunshine Coast (84.34s/1400m), 3rd at Doomben CL2 (79.89s/1350m) on soft ground.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo likely with only 7 runners. Trapedo (bar 1) and Aratiri (bar 4) can sit handy. Small field suits on-pace runners.
**Class**: Aratiri rises sharply from BM65 to BM78 (red flag). Kadall drops from BM85 placings (green light). Modesty won BM78 at Rosehill in Nov 2024 but untested on soft ground.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain - genuine wet track. Inside barriers favoured in small field.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Trapedo** ($6.50 EW) offers the best value play. Inside draw (bar 1) in a 7-horse field on soft ground is a significant advantage. Coming off a strong 3rd at Doomben in CL2 (beaten 0.15L) and a 2nd at Sunshine Coast BM68, she's racing in peak form - form reads 1-2-5-8-2-3 with 4 placings from last 6 competitive starts. Rising through the grades but carries just 54kg with a 5.5kg weight advantage over the topweights. EW EV of +24.6% qualifies on Path A.

**Master Copy** ($12.00 EW) is a dual-path EW qualifier (A+B) with a place specialist score of 2.18 (strong). Proven at the 1650m distance (2 wins from 9 starts), won at BM68 level over 1690m at Ipswich, and placed at BM78 level at Doomben (3rd, beaten 0.32L over 1600m). The concern is 0/8 on soft ground with no wins, but the EW EV of +23.9% and the price compensate for the risk.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft track specialist question**: Trapedo 0/9 on soft (4 places), Master Copy 0/8 on soft (3 places) - neither has won on the going
2. **Modesty query**: Untested on soft after strong BM78 win at Rosehill - if he handles the ground, he's the clear class runner
3. **Aratiri class rise**: Won BM65 at Ipswich by 2.86L but jumping 13 points in class - could be found out
