## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Cinque Stelle posted two dominant trial wins (1.49L, 1.88L) but times were slow (63.08s, 61.17s vs par ~59.5s). Finado's recent 2nd beaten 0.05L in 62.46s shows closing ability with race fitness.

**Pace**: MODERATE scenario. Cinque Stelle and Oscars No Grouch likely to press forward from mid-draws. Finado will need to overcome wide barrier (9) but has shown ability to position mid-field and finish strongly.

**Class**: All maiden/unraced. Finado has the most race experience (3 starts + multiple trials) and has been competitive at Belmont. Cinque Stelle untested in race conditions despite strong trial form.

**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). No significant style or barrier bias detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Cinque Stelle is clearly the most talented runner on trial form and has William Pike aboard, but at $1.65 represents a -37.3% underlay with no race-day value. The market is pricing in near-certainty for a horse that has never raced. Finado at $9.00 offers genuine each-way value (+26% edge, EW EV +13.4%) with proven race fitness, recent close 2nd at Belmont (0.05L), and improving form pattern. Path A EW qualification met: odds >= $6, EW EV >= +5%, place prob 33.6% >= 30%.

## KEY RISKS

1. Cinque Stelle may simply be too good - Pike-trained debut winners at Belmont have strong strike rates, and trial margins were decisive
2. Finado drawn wide (barrier 9) in a 1000m sprint - needs luck to get across without burning energy
3. Maiden race with 6 debutants creates unpredictable dynamics
