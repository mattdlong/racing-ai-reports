# Belmont R5 | 1600m BenchMark 56
Wed 11 Feb | 1:25pm | 15r | Good 4

## ACTION

**VALUE: #11 HOT LIKE CHILI @ $17.00 - 0.3u EW**

Marginal EW value (+1.8% combined EV). Win edge is strong at +19% but low win probability (7%) makes this a small-stake each-way play only. The dominant favourite Wonderfully Made ($1.50) is a clear underlay at -32.5% edge.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Wonderfully Made clearly fastest on raw times (84.45s/1400m at Ascot), 1-2 seconds clear of this field. Hot Like Chili ran 98.64s/1600m at Ascot in CL3 company - competitive for this grade.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Wonderfully Made and Antz Pantz Baby likely to press forward. Hot Like Chili (barrier 5) can sit midfield and use her closing ability over 1600m.
**Class**: Wonderfully Made is the class horse, winning a 3YO 0MWLY at Ascot last start. She's dropping into BM56 company - massive class edge but untested at 1600m. Hot Like Chili has run 4th in CL3 at Ascot 1600m (98.64s) - proven at the trip and competitive at this level.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). No significant style or barrier bias detected at Belmont.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Hot Like Chili offers the best value in this race at $17. She ran a solid 4th at Ascot in CL3 over 1600m (1.48L off the winner), which is stronger form than most of this BM56 field. Inside barrier (5) in a 15-horse field is a significant advantage, and the step back from CL3 to BM56 represents a class drop. The $17 price implies ~6% win probability, but her form suggests 7%+ is fair, creating a +19% edge. The dominant favourite Wonderfully Made is clearly the best horse but is an unbackable $1.50 with untested 1600m stamina (first time at the trip) and only 4 career starts.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wonderfully Made (Pike/Morton) may simply be too good regardless of price - dominant ability gap
2. Hot Like Chili's recent form sequence (4-4-8-9-4) is inconsistent; needs to reproduce her best

## EW ANALYSIS

| Horse | Win EV | Place EV | EW EV | Rating |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| #11 Hot Like Chili | +19.0% | -15.5% | +1.8% | MARGINAL |
| #6 Bella Violetta | +14.0% | -14.7% | -0.4% | NO VALUE |
| #5 Antz Pantz Baby | -1.0% | -19.9% | -10.4% | NO VALUE |

Hot Like Chili's combined EW EV is marginally positive at +1.8%, driven by strong win edge (+19%) offsetting thin place value. Small EW stake warranted.
