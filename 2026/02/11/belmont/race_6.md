# Belmont R6 | 2200m BM66
Wed 11 Feb | 1:25pm | 17r | Good 4

## ACTION

**VALUE (EW): #1 SUPER ROMANI @ $9.00 - 0.5u EW**

Place specialist (score 3.21) qualifies via Path A (Value Overlay) + Path B (Place Specialist). EW EV +6.5%. Strong 2200m credentials with inside barrier in large field.

**WATCH: #2 FLINDERS LANE @ $3.90 - NO BET**

Logical top pick with Pike aboard and last-start 2200m Ascot win, but insufficient edge (+1.4%) at current odds. Fair odds $3.85 - needs to drift to $4.50+ for value.

*#13 Toni's Spirit - SCRATCHED*

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Flinders Lane posted the best raw time at the distance (138.99s at Ascot 2200m). Super Romani won Northam 2200m in 140.32s with 0.84L margin - slower track but comfortable win under 62kg.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - no confirmed front-runners in the field. Flinders Lane and Super Romani both race on-pace which suits. Large 17-runner field means genuine tempo likely from midfield.
**Class**: Rising class for most contenders. Flinders Lane steps up from CL1 wins to BM66. Super Romani has been competitive at 0MWLY grade. Modelistic has been placed at RTG 54+ but never won beyond CL1.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). No rail position data. Large field dilutes barrier advantage but gates 1-8 still preferable over 2200m.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Super Romani (#1) represents the best each-way value at $9.00. Proven 2200m winner (Northam Sep 2024) with 67% career place rate (18/27), giving a place specialist score of 3.21. Draws barrier 2 in a 17-runner field - crucial advantage at Belmont 2200m where the field has to navigate the turns. Career record of 5 wins and 13 placings from 27 starts (48% place rate) shows remarkable consistency. The 13-day spacing is ideal and he carries 62kg but has managed weight before. At $9.00 the market is underrating his place claims, qualifying via both Path A (EW EV +6.5%) and Path B (specialist score 3.21).

Flinders Lane (#2) is the most likely winner with William Pike aboard, a last-start 2200m win at Ascot, and the highest win probability (26%). However at $3.90 the edge is razor-thin (+1.4%) and doesn't justify a bet. Monitor for drift toward $4.50+.

## KEY RISKS

1. Super Romani's best 2200m win was at provincial Northam (Sep 2024) - significant step up to Belmont metro BM66
2. Large 17-runner field creates traffic risks despite inside draw; race can become messy over 2200m
3. Flinders Lane with Pike is the clear class runner and may dominate at short odds regardless
