## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Malletier posted fastest raw 1000m (56.51s Sandown) but that's a Victorian track; Tycoon Harry fastest WA figure (57.17s Ascot). Girls Day Out's times are slower but she's been winning comfortably on a soft hold.
**Pace**: FAST expected - Tycoon Harry and Girls Day Out both on-pace types. 1000m Belmont typically suits leaders/stalkers. Contested tempo could set up closers like Military Power.
**Class**: Girls Day Out rising sharply from CL1 to BM72 - biggest class jump in field. Malletier also stepping up from VIC BM66/70. Military Power has run BM72 before and placed at this level.
**Bias**: Neutral (low confidence). Rail position not specified. No strong bias detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Military Power qualifies as EW VALUE via Path B (Place Specialist). Career 64% place rate (21/33) is exceptional and his place specialist score of 5.33 is the highest in the field. While he's been off 146 days, he trialled at Belmont on Jan 19 (5th of 10 in 60.55s). He's won twice at Belmont 1000m and has strong wet-track form (2 wins, 3 places from 4 heavy starts) if the rain worsens conditions. At $21/$4.00 place, the 18.4% place probability delivers +10.4% place EV.

Girls Day Out is the clear class act with flawless form (7 starts, 2 wins, 5 places, 100% place rate) but at $1.95 she's overbet. Fair odds sit around $2.38. No win bet recommended despite her obvious ability - the price doesn't offer edge.

## KEY RISKS

1. Military Power 146 days off - fitness query despite trial
2. Wide barrier (9) in 1000m sprint could cost lengths early
3. Girls Day Out may simply be too good for this field regardless of price
