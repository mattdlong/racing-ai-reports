# Belmont R7 | 1400m BM66
Wed 11 Feb | 1:25pm | 11r (1 scr) | Good 4 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - No runners show sufficient overlay. Market is tight with 124.9% book. Only marginal edge on #4 Zorbrist at $14 (+12%) but poor recent form (7-4-6-5-7) creates too much risk for conviction.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No sectional data available. Azena's Pinjarra 1400m (84.67s for 2nd) and Quick Cookie's Bunbury 1400m (84.10s for 2nd) are the best recent time references at the trip - very similar.
**Pace**: MODERATE - Azena (bar 2) and Quick Cookie (bar 4) likely to sit handy. Princess In Red from wide (bar 12) needs luck. No obvious leaders suggests a genuine tempo without being suicidal.
**Class**: BM66 metro is a step up for most runners coming from CL1-CL3 provincial. Tousled Crown rising from CL1, Zorbrist from CL3. Another Nephew has raced at BM66 level in Victoria.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). No rail position data. Rain forecast could shift track to Soft during meeting.

## PLACE SPECIALIST FLAGS

- **Come On Emma #10**: Place specialist score 2.68 (57% career place rate vs 24% expected). 8 places from 14 starts. Consistently fills minors but struggles to win (7% win rate). At $2.25 place odds, no EW value.
- **Tousled Crown #7**: Place specialist score 2.65 (64% career place rate). 7 places from 11 starts. Won at Pinjarra 1600m by 2.66L last prep. Rising in class is the concern.
- **Quick Cookie #12**: Place specialist score 1.70 (53% career place rate). 9 places from 17 starts. Inside draw (bar 4) is a plus.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Rain impact**: Good 4 with rain forecast - could deteriorate to Soft. Azena (2W/4P from 10 Soft starts) handles it better than most. Princess In Red (0/1 Soft) is exposed.
2. **Short-priced favourite query**: Azena has never won at 1400m (0/7 at distance). All 3 wins are at 950-1200m. Market may be overrating her based on last-start 2nd at 1400m Pinjarra.
3. **Rising class**: Multiple runners stepping up from provincial CL1/CL3 to metro BM66. Class query for Tousled Crown, Zorbrist, and Shaula.

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

The market is heavily compressed around Azena ($2.80) who I assess as a $4.55 chance. Her 0/7 distance record is a significant red flag that the market appears to be discounting. The each-way market offers no value - all EW EVs negative except Zorbrist at +8.7%, but his terrible recent form (no top-4 in 5 starts) makes this unbackable with conviction.

**Verdict**: Difficult, competitive race with no clear value. The market knows this field well and has priced it tightly. **PASS the race** and save ammunition for a clearer edge.
