## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: #7 Excess Baggage posted the best raw times at comparable distances - 1:00 flat at Belmont 1000m (winner) and 59.21s Bunbury maiden win. #6 Eternal Wine sharp 58.02s Ascot 1000m 4th but untested beyond 1100m on race day.

**Pace**: MODERATE. #7 and #6 both have tactical speed from mid-field. No confirmed leader, so expect genuine tempo without being overly contested. Mid-race movers should be advantaged.

**Class**: CL1 is bottom rung. #7 won a maiden at Bunbury then trialled at Belmont - progressive type stepping up appropriately. #6 won a maiden at Northam then ran 4th in 3YO Plate at Ascot (higher grade) - the class drop suits. #8 Fearless Talk has the most class experience (CL3 placings, CL1 competitive) but 570-day absence is enormous.

**Bias**: Neutral. Low confidence on track bias data. Rail position unknown. No adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

This race presents no actionable value. The clear top-rated runner #7 Excess Baggage (Pike/Fernie) has the best credentials - a progressive 3yo filly with a maiden win, solid trial, and the top jockey booking. However, at $2.10 she is approximately 20% short of value (fair odds ~$2.63). The market is correctly identifying her superiority but over-pricing the certainty. With barrier 10 in a 10-horse field and stepping to 1200m for the first time, there's enough risk to warrant caution.

#4 Miss Valmalenco at $7 is the closest to value (-2% edge, confidence interval includes positive), with the rain forecast potentially helping (won on soft), but Good 4 track and no course/distance form limits confidence.

## KEY RISKS

1. #7 Excess Baggage has barrier 10 (widest) and is untested at 1200m - pace pressure from wide could flatten her late
2. Rain forecast could shift track to Soft, advantaging #4 Miss Valmalenco and #6 Eternal Wine (both soft-track winners) over #7

## PLACE SPECIALIST NOTE

#8 Fearless Talk: Place specialist score 5.51 (STRONG) with 52.9% career place rate vs 9.6% expected. However, 570-day absence makes this historic form unreliable. Monitor for future starts only.
