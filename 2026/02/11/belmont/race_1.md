## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sharpassa holds best figure (72) off Bunbury maiden win in 59.37. My Testimony (69) ran fastest raw time (58.20) at Bunbury. Nistirith (67) competitive with Mt Barker 2nd in 59.11.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Small field, Gangster Goddess and Sharpassa likely to press. No genuine leader creates tempo uncertainty.
**Class**: All maidens, level playing field. Sharpassa only proven winner (1/2). Bambino Chino 0/6 exposes limitations despite decent trials.
**Bias**: Neutral bias, low confidence. Good 4 with rain - potential for track deterioration. Gangster Goddess has ZERO good track form (all soft/heavy).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#6 Nistirith** is the standout value play. Place specialist score of 2.60 (75% career place rate from 4 starts: 2nd-2nd-2nd-4th) at massive overs. Won a Belmont trial on 5 Jan, 2nd at Mt Barker last start beaten just 0.56L. At $14, the EW value is enormous (+61% EW EV) qualifying via both Path A (value overlay) and Path B (place specialist). The market is fixated on the Pike/Gangster Goddess hype and Sharpassa's maiden win, leaving Nistirith criminally unders-rated.

**#8 My Testimony** secondary play at $17 via Path C (longshot place value, +50% EW EV). Fastest raw 1000m time in field (58.20) and 2nd at Bunbury 11 Jan. Inconsistent but each-way at the price is positive EV.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Nistirith**: Wide barrier (7/8), 0 wins from 4 starts (can she convert?), stepping from Mt Barker/country to Belmont metro
2. **Gangster Goddess upset**: If Pike has her ready off a long spell, the $1.75 fav could dominate - but 181 days off with no trial is a genuine concern

## RED FLAGS

- #5 Gangster Goddess: 181 days off, no trial, zero good track form, untried at 1000m = **MASSIVE UNDERLAY at $1.75**
- #3 Sharpassa: Most likely winner but $2.90 offers no edge (-13%). Fair odds $3.33.
