## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sharpassa holds best figure (83) from Bunbury 1000m win in 59.37s. Bambino Chino next (80) from same race 2nd. Gap to rest of field.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No confirmed leader; Sharpassa and Bambino Chino likely to press forward. Should suit on-pace types.
**Class**: All maidens. Sharpassa the only race winner (won Bunbury MDN last start). Nistirith has won trial at this track, consistent placer in races.
**Bias**: No significant bias detected (LOW confidence). True rail. Rain forecast may shift ground toward soft but currently Good 4.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Nistirith represents the best value in this race at $14.00 each-way. She is a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (3.125 score, 75% place rate from 4 career starts vs 24% expected). Won a trial at Belmont 1000m, 2nd at Mt Barker last start beaten 0.56L, 2nd in two prior starts at Bunbury. The EW evaluation qualifies via both Path A (Value Overlay: EW EV +38%, place prob 32%) and Path B (Place Specialist: score 1.50). While Sharpassa is the most likely winner on raw ability, she is under the odds at $2.90 with fair value at $3.03. Gangster Goddess is a massive underlay at $1.75 - 181 days off racing, untried on good ground, all form on soft. Pike booking is the only positive.

## KEY RISKS

1. Nistirith wide barrier (7) in small field - needs luck from out
2. Rain forecast could shift track to soft, potentially benefiting Gangster Goddess who has all form on soft ground
3. Sharpassa the clear class runner - could win unchallenged if allowed easy lead
