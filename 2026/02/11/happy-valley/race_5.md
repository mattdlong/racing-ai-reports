## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Bunta Baby clocked 57.25s (winner) and 56.95s (0.3L off) at HV 1000m - best raw times in field. Beauty Thunder won in 56.88s (22/10) but barrier 11 negates. Happy United ran 0.3L off 56.95s from barrier 4.
**Pace**: FAST scenario expected - several speed runners (Beauty Thunder, Bunta Baby, Happy United) ensure genuine tempo. Suits on-pace and midfield runners. Happy United's stalking style benefits from barrier 4.
**Class**: All CL4 level. Savvy Twinkle rising from CL5 win (won 56.98s 28/01). Jackson Habit and Soaring Steed are debutants with limited trial form.
**Bias**: Firm 1 with rain - track may shift to Good during meeting. Low confidence on bias (neutral). Inside barriers historically favoured at HV 1000m due to tight turns.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Happy United offers the best value in the race at $12. He ran a strong 2nd (0.3L) in the key reference race on 28/01 from barrier 6, and now draws barrier 4 which is ideal at Happy Valley's tight 1000m. He has strong course credentials (3 wins from 27 HV starts, 2 wins from 21 at 1000m) and the place specialist profile (28% career place rate vs 21% expected) supports the each-way angle. Jamie Richards is a quality trainer and Maxime Guyon is competent. The +20% edge at $12 with strong EW EV (+12.5%) via Path B (Place Specialist score 1.33) makes this the standout play.

## KEY RISKS

1. Inconsistent recent form (12th on 08/10, long spell before that) - needs to reproduce 28/01 effort
2. Firm track with rain may not suit - 0 wins from 6 on firm, all 3 wins on good ground
