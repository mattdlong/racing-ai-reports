## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Max Que posted the best recent time (100.57s winning 1650m HV), but Flying Fortress has two 2nds beaten 0.3L in 100.03s and 99.43s - faster races, closer margins.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. No confirmed leader; Max Que and Fantastic Fun likely to press. Mid-runners should get a fair run.
**Class**: All established CL3 runners except Fivefortwo (CL4 rise) and Telecom Fighters (CL2 drop, 9yo declining). Fantastic Fun rose from CL4 but form has regressed at CL3 level.
**Bias**: Firm 1 with rain - track may shift. No significant barrier or style bias detected (LOW confidence). Inside barriers marginally preferred at HV 1650m.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Flying Fortress is the EW selection at $7.00. Two narrow 2nd placings (0.3L) at Happy Valley 1650m CL3 in fast-run races (99.43s and 100.03s) demonstrate he is competitive at this level without needing to lead. Barrier 3 is ideal at HV. Place specialist score of 1.39 (47% career place rate vs 34% expected) confirms he hits the frame regularly. EW qualifies via Path A: odds >= $6, EW EV +3.8%, place prob 38.3%. Max Que is the most likely winner (Purton, 1.3L C&D win Jan 14) but estimated $3.50 offers no edge - underlays at fair odds of $3.57.

## KEY RISKS

1. **No live odds available** - estimated $7.00 for Flying Fortress; if opens shorter than $6.00, EW value evaporates
2. **Firm 1 with rain** - track condition may shift to Good; Flying Fortress has 1 win from 7 on firm (better on good/soft)
3. **Max Que dominant** - if Purton gets an easy lead, hard to run down a 1.3L winner resuming at same C&D
