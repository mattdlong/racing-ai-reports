## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Find My Love holds fastest raw time (69.58 est) but at short price lacks value. Bits Superstar and Superb King have competitive figures around 69.9-70.0 range.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No confirmed leaders; likely Superb King or Master Resolute press forward from draws. Mid-runners benefit.
**Class**: Several dropping from CL3 (Find My Love, Holmes A Court) but neither has shown CL3 ability. Fortune Whiskey competitive at CL4 level with 5 wins from 31 starts.
**Bias**: Firm 1 with rain - track may shift during meeting. No historical bias data available (LOW confidence). Inside barriers slightly favoured at tight HV track.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Fortune Whiskey (#3) at $13 represents the best value in the race. Strong place specialist (score 2.73) with 16 HV starts including 2 wins, and recent 2nd/3rd placings show the horse is racing in good form after two below-par runs at Sha Tin (different track shape). The EW EV of +6.5% with barrier 5 at Happy Valley's tight configuration is the standout angle. The David Eustace yard is competitive and Matthew Poon knows the horse well.

## KEY RISKS

1. Two recent poor runs (8th twice) suggest possible form regression, though both were at Sha Tin not Happy Valley
2. Firm 1 track with rain forecast - Fortune Whiskey's best form is on soft (3 wins from 7 starts on soft), so rain may actually help if the track deteriorates
