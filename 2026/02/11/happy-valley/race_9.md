## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Lucky Planet has the best recent times (69.32, 69.37 winning at HV 1200m), with Perfect General close (69.75 winning). Both have figures 3-5pts clear of the rest.
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected. No dominant leader; Lucky Planet, Lucky Eight, and Harmony N Blessed likely to contest the front. Suits on-pacers and one-off runners.
**Class**: Several runners rising from CL3/CL4 wins. Lucky Planet won CL4 then 2nd in CL3 last start - progressive. Perfect General won CL3 two back, progressive profile. Lucky Eight won CL4 at Sha Tin last start, jumps two classes - query.
**Bias**: HKJC "A" Course on Good. No significant bias detected (LOW confidence). Inside barriers have marginal advantage at HV 1200m tight track. Benefits Lucky Eight (1), Everstar (3), Lucky Planet (4). Hurts Refusetobeenglish (12), Perfect General (11).

## EXPERT CONSENSUS (7 SCMP Sources)

| Horse | Mentions | Support |
|-------|----------|---------|
| #3 Lucky Planet | 7/7 | 100% |
| #7 Refusetobeenglish | 5/7 | 71% |
| #5 Perfect General | 4/7 | 57% |
| #10 Spirit Of Peace | 3/7 | 43% |
| #6 Lucky Eight | 3/7 | 43% |

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Lucky Planet (#3)** is the standout. Won CL4 by 2.8L three starts back, then 3rd and 2nd in CL3 company - clearly progressive and ready to strike at CL2. Excellent Happy Valley record (18 starts, 3 wins) and strong 1200m stats (26 starts, 4 wins). Inside barrier (4) is ideal at the tight HV track. Universal expert support (7/7 sources). The concern is estimating fair odds - if he opens at $4.00 or shorter, the edge may be thin. **Target: back at $4.50+ for value.**

**Perfect General (#5)** is the EW play. Strong Place Specialist score of 1.98 (75% career place rate from 12 starts). Won CL3 two back and placed 3rd last start. Caspar Fownes in strong form. The wide barrier (11) at HV is a significant negative but E C W Wong knows the track. **Target: EW at $6.00+ (Place Specialist angle).**

## KEY RISKS

1. **No confirmed odds** - all pricing is estimated; edge/Kelly calculations require verification at race time
2. **Wide barriers** - Perfect General (11) and Refusetobeenglish (12) face significant disadvantage at tight-turning Happy Valley
3. **Class rise for all** - many runners stepping up from CL3/CL4; uncertain if form translates

## BETTING TRIGGERS

- **Lucky Planet**: BACK WIN if odds >= $4.50 (implied 22.2% vs est. 22% true prob)
- **Perfect General**: BACK EW if odds >= $6.00 (Place Specialist 1.98, 75% place rate)
- **Lucky Eight**: BACK EW if odds >= $8.00 (Place Specialist 1.80, rail draw)
- **Refusetobeenglish**: WATCH only - Purton booking is the plus but barrier 12 at HV is brutal
