## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Meowth (87) and Flying Wrote (88) are virtually inseparable on figures, 5+ pts clear of the rest. Giant Leap (82) rates third but that came in CL3 at Sha Tin.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - Meowth and Flying Wrote both race on-pace, no confirmed leaders to set a strong tempo. Should suit stalkers.
**Class**: Giant Leap dropping from CL3 to CL4 is the notable class move. Blazing Beam rising from CL5 win to CL4 is the risk. All others are CL4 regulars.
**Bias**: Firm 1 track, no significant bias detected (LOW confidence). Happy Valley's tight turning track generally favours inside barriers and on-pace runners.

## PLACE ANALYSIS

| Horse | Place% | Specialist | EW EV |
|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| Meowth | 55.4% | - | N/A (short price) |
| Flying Wrote | 46.0% | - | N/A (short price) |
| Giant Leap | 29.4% | 1.68 STRONG | -3.8% |
| The Heir | 28.3% | 2.23 STRONG | -22.5% |
| King Glorioso | 26.0% | 2.38 STRONG | -33.3% |
| Blazing Beam | 20.1% | - | +5.2% EW |

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Meowth** is the clear top pick with unanimous expert support (8/8 tipsters), the joint-highest speed figure, excellent Happy Valley form (5 starts: 1-2-0-2), prime barrier (5), and Hugh Bowman booking. His last two HV runs were 2nd by 0.5L and 2nd by 0.2L - he's knocking on the door. The $4.40 represents marginal value (+5.6% edge) on a horse that should be closer to $4.17 fair odds. At quarter Kelly this yields a 1.4u WIN bet.

**Flying Wrote** is the main danger with similarly strong HV form (18 starts: 2-2-1 at course) and the inside draw (3), but at $4.60 represents an underlay (-8.0% edge). Strong chance but no bet at current odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. Meowth's two most recent starts produced 2nd placings - he may be a horse that finds one too good
2. Rain forecast could change the Firm 1 track to yielding - Meowth has zero starts on soft/heavy
