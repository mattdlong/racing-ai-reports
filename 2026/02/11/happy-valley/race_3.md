## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Inno Super holds the best raw figure (82) off a CL4 2nd at HV last start; California Banner (79) and Prestige Ricky (78) next best on recent HV 1650m times.
**Pace**: MODERATE - no obvious leaders. Inno Super (bar 1) and Northern Beast (bar 4) likely to sit handy; suits on-pace runners without strong bias.
**Class**: All runners at CL4 level. Setanta (68 starts, 7 wins) and Northern Beast dropping from CL3 attempts have the class edge. Prestige Ricky and Absolute Awakened also competitive at this level.
**Bias**: Track condition Firm 1 with rain forecast. Harmony Galaxy (2 from 8 on firm) and Setanta (0/8 on firm) - firm track is a concern for Setanta but rain may ease ground. No significant barrier or style bias detected (LOW confidence).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Setanta** (EW @ $14) qualifies via Path B - Place Specialist. Career 40% place rate (27 placings from 68 starts, specialist score 2.12) makes him an outstanding each-way proposition at double-figure odds. Has been hitting the frame consistently at HV 1650m (2nd and 3rd in last 3 HV runs). The $14 represents +26% win edge and +11.7% combined EW EV. Wide barrier (11) is a concern but his closing style can overcome it in a moderate-pace scenario. Jockey A Atzeni and trainer M Newnham are a competent combination.

**California Banner** (WIN @ $12) shows +20% edge based on form trajectory - 3rd at HV 1650m last start (Jan 14), previously 2nd at Sha Tin 1400m. Improving profile with 4 placings from 15 starts despite being a maiden. The $12 offers sufficient margin at fair odds of $10.

## EXPERT CONSENSUS

| Horse | Expert Support | Sources |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| #8 Inno Super | 100% (6/6) | Rooney, Goulding, Trackwork, Woo, Shannon, Wood |
| #4 Prestige Ricky | 67% (4/6) | Rooney, Goulding, Racing Post, Wood |
| #6 Northern Beast | 50% (3/6) | Trackwork, Shannon, Racing Post |
| #3 Absolute Awakened | 50% (3/6) | Trackwork, Woo, Wood |
| #2 Noble Pursuit | 33% (2/6) | Goulding, Racing Post |

Note: Expert consensus heavily favours Inno Super but $3.70 is too short for 18% true win probability. We go against the crowd for value.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Setanta** wide barrier (11) in 12-runner field - needs luck from back
2. **Firm track** may not suit Setanta (0 wins from 8 firm starts) but rain forecast may soften ground
3. **Inno Super** is the clear class runner - if he runs to best, the value plays may struggle to place
