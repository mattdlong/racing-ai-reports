## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Mighty Commander (69.36s) and Power Koepp (69.31s) hold the best recent CL3 times at HV 1200m; Amazing Kid's 69.61-69.65s were in CL4 company.
**Pace**: MODERATE - no confirmed leaders, Mighty Commander and Tourbillon Golfer map to sit handy from inside draws (bar 2 and 1). Mid-pack runners will need luck.
**Class**: Amazing Kid rises from CL4 (3 straight wins) to CL3 for the first time - the key question of the race. Mighty Commander won CL3 here on 14 Jan and is proven at this level.
**Bias**: Firm 1 track, no significant style or barrier bias detected (LOW confidence). Inside draws marginally favoured at HV 1200m historically.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Mighty Commander at $8.20 represents STRONG VALUE with a +23% edge. He won this grade at HV over 1200m on 14 Jan (beating Tourbillon Golfer and Sports Legend), then ran 4th last start beaten just 1.3L in a fast-run CL3 (69.36s). Alexis Badel retains the ride, barrier 2 is ideal to settle handy, and Caspar Fownes is a proven HV trainer. The EW proposition is strong (EW EV +11.9%, Path A qualified) with 35.7% place probability. The market has over-reacted to Bienvenue ($3.40) whose 97-day absence and vet history (bled both nostrils, irregular heart rhythm last prep) make him a risky favourite.

## EW CASE

- **Path A qualified**: Odds $8.20 >= $6, EW EV +11.9% >= +5%, Place prob 36% >= 30%
- Win EV: +23.0% | Place EV: +0.8%
- Place odds: ~$2.80 (1/4 terms)

## KEY RISKS

1. Mighty Commander has 0 wins from 6 starts on Firm going (1 place) - prefers Good tracks
2. Rain forecast could shift track to better conditions for him, but if it stays Firm his record is a concern

## MARKET WATCH

- **#6 Bienvenue ($3.40)**: Over-bet. 97-day break, bled from both nostrils last prep, 10th in final start. Purton booking props up the price. Fair odds ~$5.50. **UNDERLAY.**
- **#11 Amazing Kid ($4.40)**: 3 straight CL4 wins but untested in CL3. Times are slower than proven CL3 runners. Market is pricing in the class rise correctly.
- **#9 Tourbillon Golfer ($6.30)**: STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score 2.604). 75% place rate (6/8). Rail draw is ideal. Fair price but no win edge. **Place-only interest.**
