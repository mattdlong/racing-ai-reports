## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sumo Sandy has the best raw speed figure (84) from a fast 96.47s Cranbourne 1600m win, but that was on Good ground. Curse It (82) won the same Caulfield Heath race Blakmax (68) ran 4th in. Rapid Cheval (80) has QLD form at 1800m but is unproven on soft.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No dominant leader in this field. Sumo Sandy and Humza Bey likely to sit handy from barriers 1 and 4. Sotomayor well drawn in 3 to get a soft run mid-field. Eye For An Eye will need to come from back given barrier 9.

**Class**: Most runners are BM62-66 level. Eye For An Eye has the highest class rating (82) from BM70/78 placings but is returning from 76 days off. Humza Bey won a BM65 on heavy at Wanganui NZ - class is comparable. Sotomayor rising through grades after winning BM62 at Wangaratta last start.

**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain is the DOMINANT factor. Only Humza Bey (2/2 heavy, 0/1 soft) and Eye For An Eye (2/11 soft) have proven wet form. Sumo Sandy (0/0 wet), Curse It (0/0 wet), and Rapid Cheval (0/3 soft) are significant downgrade on this surface. Sotomayor has 1 win from 3 on soft/heavy.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#4 Humza Bey** is the clear selection on a Soft 5 track with rain continuing. His entire winning record comes on heavy ground (2/2) with a soft track 3rd at Sale last start. The Price/Kent stable provides a significant connections upgrade at provincial level. While untested at 1600m, he won at 1340m and 1400m on heavy with authority (1L+ margins), and the step up in trip on a soft track should suit. At $4.40 he represents +23.2% edge over his $3.57 fair odds. The market is fixated on Sumo Sandy's superior dry-track form, but Sumo Sandy has ZERO wet track experience - a massive risk on a deteriorating Soft 5.

**#7 Sotomayor** at $14 is the each-way play. Two straight wins, improving trajectory, good draw (3), and some wet track credentials (won on heavy at Hamilton). The EW EV of +28.7% is strong, with combined win + place value.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Humza Bey** is unproven at 1600m - all wins at 1340-1400m. The distance query is real, though soft ground typically suits those wanting to stay.
2. If the track firms up before race time (unlikely given rain forecast), the wet-track edge diminishes and **Sumo Sandy** becomes the clear play at shorter odds.
3. **Sotomayor** is rising through grades quickly and may find BM66 a step too far despite the wet advantage.
