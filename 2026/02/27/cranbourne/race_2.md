## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Olney posted the benchmark figure winning this C/D (2080m BM66, 128.11s) three weeks ago; Global Eclipse ran a solid 125.76s at Caulfield 2000m BM70 but was beaten 1.75L.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no confirmed leaders, Convo and Customer Service likely to settle forward from inside gates. Suits on-pace and midfield runners.
**Class**: This is a BM66 provincial. Global Eclipse drops from BM70 metro (Caulfield) but is heavily compressed in price. Olney won at this exact level 3 weeks ago. Customer Service steps up from BM62 country wins. Broadhurst rises from BM62 win.
**Bias**: Soft 5 track, neutral bias (LOW confidence). No rail position data. Soft track suits Convo (1w/2p from 4 soft) and Customer Service (1w/1p from 3 soft). Global Eclipse untested in heavy/soft (0w/2p from 2 soft with no wins). Olney poor on soft (0w/1p from 2 soft) - KEY RISK.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#7 Olney** is the clear value play at $8.50. Won this exact course and distance (Cranbourne 2080m BM66) just 3 weeks ago by 0.2L in a time of 128.11s. Has strong course form (3 starts, 1 win, 1 third at Cranbourne). The +27.5% edge represents STRONG VALUE with fair odds of $6.67. EW EV of +22.7% and place specialist score of 1.389 make the each-way bet compelling. The main concern is soft track form (0 wins from 2 soft starts) but placed once, and the good track win here was recent and authoritative. Beau Mertens retains the ride.

**#6 Customer Service** offers secondary value at $16. Won at Seymour 2246m BM62 by 0.15L last start, showing the stamina for this trip. Barrier 1 is a significant advantage on a soft track where saving ground matters. Michael Dee is a strong booking. The +12.0% edge and EW EV of +14.7% warrant a small each-way saver. Won maiden on soft at Echuca 2100m.

**#2 Global Eclipse** is the class runner and deserved favourite, but $2.15 is far too short. Fair odds are $3.33, making this a -35.5% underlay. The 83% career place rate is remarkable, but 0 wins from 2 soft track starts is a concern at the short price. WATCH only.

## KEY RISKS

1. Olney's soft track record (0 wins from 2 soft) - this is the primary risk factor
2. Global Eclipse's class advantage could see it dominate regardless of value calculations
3. Customer Service stepping up in class from country BM62 to provincial BM66
