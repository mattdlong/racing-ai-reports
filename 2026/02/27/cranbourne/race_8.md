## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Seafall has the best metro figures from Flemington/Caulfield BM78 form. En Flique improving rapidly, last win by 1.25L at Caulfield Heath suggests upward trajectory. Grey Ice has strong Caulfield 1600m figure (2nd, 0.25L off winner).

**Pace**: MODERATE scenario likely. No confirmed leaders; Seafall, Grey Ice and Stage 'N' Screen all race on-pace. En Flique settles midfield and finishes strongly. Small field (8r) should produce a genuine tempo without excessive pressure.

**Class**: En Flique rising sharply from BM62/66 to BM78 after three wins from four starts - the key question. Stage 'N' Screen also rising (first time BM78). Seafall and Grey Ice tested at this level. Madame Lexis won BM66 at 2500m, drops in distance.

**Bias**: Soft 5 is the critical factor. Grey Ice has 0/2 on soft (but 2/2 heavy). En Flique 0/3 soft - a genuine concern. Seafall 3/7 on soft stands out. Madame Lexis 2/10 soft is acceptable.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

En Flique is the only runner showing genuine value against the market. Three wins from four starts (1-2-1-3) with progressive times and margins is the strongest form trajectory in the race. The $7.00 price implies 14.3% probability; our assessment of 16% gives a +12% edge. EW EV is +14% with place probability of 46.4% (place specialist score 2.08). The class rise from BM66 to BM78 is the main uncertainty, but the manner of the last win (1.25L, BM66 at 1800m Caulfield Heath) suggests he's ahead of his rating. The market favorites Stage 'N' Screen ($3.00) and Grey Ice ($3.60) are both underlays with negative edge.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft track query**: En Flique is 0/3 on soft ground - untested form on rain-affected tracks is a genuine concern at this level
2. **Class rise**: Jumping from BM62/66 provincial form to BM78 at Cranbourne is a significant step - may find these too strong
3. **Wide barrier (7)**: In a small field this is manageable but not ideal over 2025m
