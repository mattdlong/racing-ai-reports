## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Celsius Star (91) and Suparazi (91) share the top raw figure but Suparazi 0/13 at 1200m is a massive concern; Corniche (90) not far behind with proven wet-track ability.
**Pace**: MODERATE - small field with no confirmed leaders. Celsius Star (bar 1) and Give Me Space likely to sit handy. Should suit on-pace types.
**Class**: Give Me Space has the highest class rating (90) from BM70/Open 3YO wins at Eagle Farm/Doomben, but hasn't raced in 314 days and faces a Soft 5 for only the second time (0/1 soft).
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Rain and Soft 5 will favour wet-trackers and inside barriers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Corniche** (EW $15.00) represents the best value play. Strong wet-track form (1/3 soft, 1/2 heavy including a dominant 3L win at Rosehill on Heavy), 167 days off but won a jump-out first-up on 16/02. Bobbie Lewis (G3) form at Flemington reads well for this class level. Inside barrier (2) ideal on a rain-affected track. Place specialist score of 2.97 (STRONG) with 57% career place rate. EW EV of +16.0% is the best play in the race.

**Miss Icelandic** (EW $11.00) offers secondary EW value. Course specialist with 2/2 wins at Cranbourne (both 1200m), strong place specialist (2.08 score, 50% career place rate), and proven on soft (2/8 wins, 5/8 places). Ran 5th at Hobart last start on Soft - some query there, but Cranbourne track knowledge is a genuine edge.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Corniche**: 167 days between races, last competitive start was Sep '25 Bobbie Lewis (10th); relying on wet-track form from winter '25
2. **Give Me Space**: Clear class standout but 314 days off and untested on soft - if handling conditions, could blow away this field at unders
3. **Track deterioration**: Continued rain could push to Heavy, benefiting Corniche further but potentially disadvantaging other selections
