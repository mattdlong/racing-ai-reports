## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Gentle Steel (85) and Blackberry Bomb (84) hold the top figures, but BB offers 4x the odds. Shirshov's BM84 second (82) adds depth but wide draw hurts.
**Pace**: MODERATE - several on-pace runners (#8, #4, #10) should ensure genuine tempo. Mid-runners and stalkers get an honest chase. No clear leader.
**Class**: Gentle Steel rises from a Caulfield Heath BM70 win; Blackberry Bomb last ran 3rd in BM78 at this track - proven at this level. Cannyworth steps up from BM64 but has quality.
**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain - no reliable bias data (LOW confidence). Wet track favours #8 (67% soft win rate), #4 (50% soft/heavy), and #6 (29% soft). Egerton is the big query with no wet form.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Blackberry Bomb** is the clear value play at $10. Course specialist with 2 wins from 4 starts at Cranbourne, including a BM66 win over this trip in 55.68s. Last start 3rd in BM78 here (0.4L off winner in 55.23s) proves competitiveness at this level. The $10 price implies just 10% chance but our model rates 14% - a +40% edge. EW value is strong at +35% EV with 40% place probability.

**Cannyworth** offers secondary value at $6. The 3yo by Damian Lane won on Soft at Bendigo and on Heavy at Bendigo - relishes wet ground. Two wins from three sprint starts show natural speed. Stepping up to BM74 from BM64 is the query, but Lane's booking signals confidence. EW EV +13.2%.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Gentle Steel** may simply be too good - 50% win rate, won last start, soft track proven. The price is short but the horse is genuine.
2. **Soft 5 with rain** could deteriorate to Heavy - would further advantage Cannyworth/Gentle Steel and disadvantage our primary pick Blackberry Bomb (1/4 on soft).
3. **Blackberry Bomb** wide barrier (5 of 9) in a small field sprint - needs to find cover early or may burn petrol.

## EW ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Win EV | Place Prob | Place EV | EW EV | Rating |
|---|-------|--------|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| 7 | Blackberry Bomb | +40.0% | 40.0% | +30.0% | +35.0% | STRONG EW |
| 6 | Hello Romeo | +20.0% | 35.0% | +13.7% | +16.9% | STRONG EW |
| 4 | Cannyworth | +14.0% | 50.0% | +12.5% | +13.2% | STRONG EW |

**Place Specialists**: #5 Egerton (score 2.16, 73% career placing) and #1 Shirshov (score 2.69, 52% career placing) - but neither offers win value at current odds.
