## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Attachments clearly best on recent form (2nd BM66 Sandown by 0.4L, won Kilmore BM66 by 2.25L). Street Conqueror next best (3rd BM70 Cranbourne).
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No confirmed leaders creates uncertainty. Don't Russia (bar 3) and Attachments (bar 5) best placed tactically.
**Class**: Attachments has highest class ceiling (38% win rate from 8 starts). Don't Russia competitive at BM66 level with 2nd at Caulfield last start.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Soft 5 track is the key differentiator - strongly favours Don't Russia (3 wins from 11 soft starts, all career wins on soft).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Don't Russia is the clear Each-Way value play. All three career wins have come on soft/heavy ground (3/11 soft, vs 0/10 good), making the Soft 5 surface a massive positive. Second at Caulfield Heath last start in BM66 (0.75L margin) demonstrates current fitness and class level. Barrier 3 gives a tactical advantage, and Craig Newitt is a capable booking. The $8.50 represents slight value with EW EV of +5.6% and place specialist score of 1.42.

Attachments is clearly the best horse in the race and should win, but at $1.65 (implied 60.6%) is heavily underlaid against a fair price of $2.08. No value backing at those odds despite being the most likely winner.

## KEY RISKS

1. Attachments may simply be too good - 2.25L BM66 win and 0.4L 2nd at BM66 is dominant form
2. Don't Russia has 0 wins at 1200m (6 starts) - better suited at shorter trips (1000m specialist)
