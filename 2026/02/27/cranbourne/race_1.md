## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No meaningful speed figures available - nearly all runners are unraced or lightly raced maidens with no sectional data. Balance's Caulfield Listed run (6th/12, 1.5L margin, 62.59s/1100m) is the standout benchmark.

**Pace**: MODERATE. Limited early speed engaged. Balance likely to settle mid-field from barrier 7. No genuine speed horses identified - On My Own and Salarae showed some early presence in their limited starts but neither is prominent here.

**Class**: Balance vastly superior. 6th in the Kev Hayes Stakes (Listed, Caulfield) is 2+ class levels above a provincial maiden. Juvenal placed at Port Macquarie and in barrier trials at Rosehill/Warwick Farm (Mick Price/Michael Kent Jnr yard). Carriedo 3rd at Kyneton maiden - honest form. The rest are very moderate.

**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain - no track bias data available (LOW confidence). Balance and Juvenal both untested on soft ground. Carriedo has one soft start (4th at Geelong). Wet track is a genuine query for the top two in the market.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Balance is the class runner by a wide margin - a Listed-class filly in a weak provincial maiden. Even 6th in the Kev Hayes at Caulfield represents superior ability. However, at $1.60 she needs to win ~63% of the time to be value, and my assessment is ~50% given: (1) untested on soft ground, (2) stepping to 1200m for the first time, (3) first time at Cranbourne, (4) only one career start. The gap between talent and price creates a NO BET.

Juvenal (#4, $6.50) is the most interesting alternative - consistent placer in trials from the Price/Kent yard with Jordan Childs booked. But only 1 start for 2nd and stepping to 1200m on an unknown wet track. Place specialist score of 3.2 is notable but EW value is still -8.8% at current price.

## KEY RISKS

1. Soft 5 with rain could worsen to Heavy - Balance and Juvenal both untested on wet ground
2. Thin maiden with very limited form data makes probability estimation unreliable

## PLACE SPECIALIST NOTE

Juvenal (#4): Place specialist score 3.2 (STRONG). 100% placing rate (1/1 starts). Monitor if odds drift to $8+ where EW may approach breakeven.
