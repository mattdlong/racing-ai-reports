## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Tower Bridge best figure (78) from BM62 Sale win, 4-6pts clear of maiden-grade rivals. Only runner with a rating-class win.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo likely with Fly By Light and Tower Bridge both on-pace types. Small field, no confirmed leaders -- genuine speed unlikely to run along.
**Class**: Massive class rise for entire field -- all are maidens/BM62 stepping into Listed company. Tower Bridge has the edge having won a BM62 and run 2nd in 0-66 at Sandown. Fly By Light and Arlington Row both maiden winners only.
**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain -- no significant barrier or style bias detected (LOW confidence). Tower Bridge 1-from-2 on soft; Fly By Light untested on soft (0 starts).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Tower Bridge is the class horse in this field at a price that significantly overestimates the favourite Fly By Light. Tower Bridge has the highest speed figure (78) from a BM62 win at Sale, is proven on soft ground (1/1 on soft tracks), and is trained by Ciaron Maher with Damian Lane aboard -- a potent combination. The market has Fly By Light as a $2.60 favourite off a single maiden win on Good ground, creating a clear overlay on Tower Bridge at $5.50. The +21% edge and 69% place probability provide a strong value play.

## KEY RISKS

1. No Cranbourne course form -- first start at the track (0 from 0)
2. Class rise from BM62 to Listed is significant, though the whole field faces similar jump
3. Last win was at 1006m (Sale) -- needs to confirm at 1200m on a wet track
