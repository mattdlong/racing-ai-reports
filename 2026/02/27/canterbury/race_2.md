| 5 | Andrea | 8 | $13.00 | POOR | 3:1-2 | Cold | 30.0 | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Melanite and Penpel rate closely on adjusted times; Melanite's 1000-1100m figures translate best to 1200m on a rain-affected surface.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - no confirmed leaders in a small field, likely a genuine tempo with Melanite and Rajwa handy.
**Class**: Penpel and Melanite both rising from maiden/CL1 to BM64; Penpel has the bigger trial form but untested at 1200m. Rajwa has proven BM64 form at Canterbury.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence) - rail position not specified, Soft 7 on rain means conditions may deteriorate further.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Melanite is the value play at $6.00 in a race where the favourite Penpel ($2.40) has clear vulnerabilities - never raced beyond 1100m and coming off a 135-day break despite a sharp trial. Melanite's wet track record (4 starts: 1-0-3) is the best in the field and translates perfectly to a Soft 7 with rain. Won maiden on soft at Gold Coast, ran 3rd on soft at Wyong last start in CL1 company. The step to BM64 is manageable. At $6.00 with 20% estimated edge, the EW bet provides strong downside protection via 61% place probability and +28.6% EW EV (Path A qualified).

Beverly Hills ($4.60) and Great Heights ($7.00) are both Waller runners with premium jockey bookings but critically have zero or near-zero wet track credentials - Beverly Hills 1 start on soft for 0-0-0, Great Heights has never started on soft or heavy. On a Soft 7 deteriorating, these are dangerous underlays.

## KEY RISKS

1. Melanite untested at 1200m - all form at 800-1100m; needs to see out the trip on heavy ground
2. Penpel's class may be superior if she handles the 1200m - sharp trial suggests fitness is there despite the long break
