## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Okami Star posted 117.44s over this C&D last start (3rd, beaten 0.11L) - best proven form at the trip. Savvy Spy's 93.98s/1550m strong but untested at 1900m.
**Pace**: MODERATE - no confirmed leaders. El Paso and Okami Star likely mid-pack. Savvy Spy and Defendant will settle off the pace. Should suit runners who can sustain a run.
**Class**: Several runners stepping up significantly. Defendant (maiden to BM64), Velaris (maiden to BM64), Think I Do (country BM58 to metro BM64). Okami Star proven at this level with 3rd at Canterbury 1900m BM64 last start.
**Bias**: Soft 7 with rain is the dominant factor. Okami Star is 2/6 on heavy and ran 3rd C&D on good - genuine wet tracker. Savvy Spy is 0/1 soft with zero heavy starts - massive query at $2.80.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Okami Star** is the clear value play. Ran 3rd beaten just 0.11L over this exact course and distance (Canterbury 1900m BM64) last start on Good ground, and now gets a Soft 7 surface where his heavy track record (2 wins from 6) should provide an edge. Barrier 6 is workable and he draws into a nice midfield position. At $6.50, the market hasn't fully adjusted for the wet track advantage. The +17% edge with EW value via Path A (EV +15.5%) makes this a solid each-way play.

**Think I Do** is the roughie EW play. She's a strong place specialist (score 3.04) with a 73% place rate from career starts. She handles wet ground (won on heavy, placed on soft) and gets the coveted rail draw (barrier 1) which becomes even more valuable on a deteriorating track. Stepping from country to metro is the concern, but at $12 the EW EV is +31.2% - qualifying via both Path A and Path B.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Okami Star**: Soft 0/9 despite heavy track wins - the Soft 7 may not be wet enough to fully activate his mud form
2. **Think I Do**: Country class to metro BM64 is a significant jump; apprentice jockey claim helps on weight but reduces experience edge
3. **Savvy Spy** may prove better on wet ground than his limited record suggests - only 3 career starts means small sample size

## MARKET ALERT

Savvy Spy ($2.80) is a strong **OPPOSE** - the market prices him at 35.7% but wet-adjusted probability is closer to 16%. Fair odds $6.25. The 0/1 soft record with no heavy track experience at a Soft 7 Canterbury makes this a classic false favourite scenario.
