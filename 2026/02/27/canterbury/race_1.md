## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Avengers posted the most dominant trial win (1.43L Canterbury 899m, 54.93s) and showed clear acceleration. Euripedes has the best race form with a 3rd at 1100m and a trial win at 900m.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Several on-pace types (Euripedes, Concrete Storm, Universe) should set honest speed without it being suicidal. Suits runners who can track and finish.
**Class**: All runners are 2YO types stepping to race day or second starters. Euripedes (5 starts) has the experience edge. Avengers won a strong Canterbury trial beating Universe and Promenade.
**Bias**: Soft 7 with rail out 3m. No strong bias detected (LOW confidence). Inside barriers get a marginal advantage on the tight Canterbury circuit. Barrier 18 for Concrete Storm is a significant negative.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Avengers** (#15, $10 EW) is the standout value play. Won a Canterbury trial dominantly by 1.43L in 54.93s, which is the strongest visual and time performance from any runner in this field at the course. Barrier 8 is workable, Nash Rawiller is a strong jockey booking, and the A&S Freedman yard is in solid form. At $10 the market is underrating a horse with a clear Canterbury course win and the fastest closing sectionals in trials. The +40% edge with 29.5% EW EV qualifies via Path A (odds >= $6, EW EV >= +5%, place prob 37% >= 30%).

**Ektifire** (#13, $15 EW) gets the secondary play. Ran 2nd at her most recent Randwick trial on soft ground (relevant given tonight's Soft 7) and draws barrier 2 on the tight Canterbury track. Tim Clark booking is positive. At $15 the 20% edge provides a speculative EW play.

## KEY RISKS

1. **2YO race with limited form** - Most runners are on debut or second start, making speed figures unreliable and any analysis inherently low-confidence
2. **Soft 7 track** - Wet track form is untested for nearly every runner; any horse with natural soft-track ability could outperform
3. **Barrier 18 for Concrete Storm** ($4.40 fav) - Major negative on tight Canterbury track, yet market has it as second fav. If it overcomes the draw, our value selections may be displaced

## CAVEATS

Data quality: MEDIUM. Limited trial-only form for most runners. Expert tip sources largely paywalled (1 source checked). Speed figures estimated from trial times only - treat with caution.
