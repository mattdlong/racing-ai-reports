## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Piperita posted dominant 4.35L win at Wyong on soft; Ivan's Hero competitive C&D figures.
**Pace**: MODERATE - no clear leader, suits mid-runners. Barrier 1 (Mornington Pier) and barrier 2 (Copacabana) get ideal runs.
**Class**: Cellarmaster making biggest class rise (MDN/CL1 to BM78). Piperita also jumping from BM64. Ivan's Hero and Mornington Pier proven at BM72-78 level.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Soft 7 heavily penalises good-track specialists.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Mornington Pier gets the EW nod at $7.50. Barrier 1 with Jason Collett aboard is a significant advantage on a wet Canterbury where leaders/on-pacers typically get favourable runs. Wet track record of 3 wins from 11 starts on soft/heavy is strong, including a 1.72L win at Kensington 1550m on soft. He ran 4th in BM78 grade at Randwick on heavy (beaten just 0.1L), proving he can compete at this level on rain-affected tracks. Place specialist score of 1.99 (67% career place rate) supports the EW angle. The main concern is his last-start 5th at Warwick Farm, but that was over 1400m - the step to 1550m suits.

Piperita is the main danger with brilliant wet form (won by 4.35L on soft last start) but the class jump from BM64 to BM78 is significant and she has never raced over 1550m. Marginal EW value only.

Cellarmaster is the clear PASS at $2.30 - 0 wins from 2 on soft, untested at 1550m, and jumping from CL1 to BM78. Massive underlay.

## KEY RISKS

1. Mornington Pier's last two runs (5th, 6th) suggest he may need a softer target than BM78
2. If track deteriorates to heavy, unknowns increase for several runners
3. Small field of 9 reduces place value (only 3 places paid)
