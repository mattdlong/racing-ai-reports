| 10 | Burj | 2 | 4.80 | GOOD | 76 | GOOD | Neutral | 42.0 | WATCH |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited timing data available; Super Bright's Canterbury 1250m Soft win (73.66s) is the benchmark figure for this field on rain-affected ground.
**Pace**: MODERATE - small field with Diddle Dumpling (bar 1) and Burj (bar 2) likely to press forward. Genuine speed lacking, suits on-pace types.
**Class**: BM78 metro, Sacred Rocks and Slinky proven at this level. Super Bright won BM72 last start, slight class rise. Mystery Lad coming from country cups - major class jump.
**Bias**: Neutral bias confidence LOW. Soft 7 with rain favours wet-trackers heavily. Inside barriers advantaged in small field.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Super Bright is the standout value play at $9.50. This 7yo mare has ALL 6 career wins on soft/heavy ground (6/19 on soft, 0/19 on good) - a genuine wet-track specialist. She won at Canterbury 1250m on Soft (16 Jan, BM72) beating Slinky by 1.36L, and now meets that rival again at the same track/distance on an even softer surface. The slight class rise to BM78 is the only query, but at nearly $10 with a 55.8% EW expected value, the price more than compensates. Dylan Gibbons retains the ride.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

Super Bright qualifies via **Path A**: Odds $9.50 (>=$6), EW EV +55.8% (>= +5%), Place prob 45% (>= 30%). Place odds of $3.60 provide standalone place value (+40.6% place EV).

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise from BM72 to BM78 - untested at this level on soft (previous BM78 runs on good ground yielded 5th-9th finishes)
2. Diddle Dumpling ($2.00 fav) has Nash Rawiller, barrier 1, and Ryan/Alexiou stable firing - genuine talent if finding form

## MARKET NOTES

Diddle Dumpling is a clear **UNDERLAY** at $2.00 (fair odds $2.86). Resuming off barrier trials with patchy recent form (5th, 4th in trials). Market heavily influenced by connections (Rawiller/Ryan-Alexiou) and barrier draw rather than current form evidence. Sacred Rocks returning from 181 days off - significant query despite strong career record.
