# Canterbury R4 | 1900m BM78
Fri 27 Feb | 7:30pm | 7r (3 scratched) | Soft 7

## ACTION

**VALUE: #5 KENMARE BAY @ $3.40 - EW WATCH (Place Lean)**

Win edge is marginal (-4.8%, CI: +4.7% to -14.3%). Place probability 85% on career consistency (16/18 placings) makes the $1.30 place price interesting but short. **Monitor for drift to $3.80+ for EW engagement.**

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Powerhouse clocked 98.22s winning 1600m at Newcastle (best recent figure in field), stepping up to 1900m for first time. Kenmare Bay's 116.30s for 2nd at Canterbury 1900m two weeks ago is the best time at today's track/distance.

**Pace**: SLOW expected. Small field, no obvious leaders. Kenmare Bay and Powerhouse both settle midfield. Semper Fortis and Pleasure Artist likely to lead. Slow pace favours on-speed runners - slight negative for Kenmare Bay who settles back.

**Class**: Powerhouse rising sharply (CL1 provincial to BM78 metro). Kenmare Bay stable at BM78 after 2nd here last start. One Step Closer jumps massively (maiden winner to Vic Derby 4th to BM78 - untested). Pleasure Artist won BM72 here in Dec, slight rise.

**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Soft 7 track is the key variable - heavily favours wet-track performers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Kenmare Bay** is the value play in this race based on three pillars: (1) outstanding wet-track record (5w 4p from 12 starts on soft/heavy, including a Canterbury 1900m heavy-track win), (2) exceptional place consistency (16 placings from 18 starts = 89% place rate), and (3) proven at this exact track/distance (2 wins from 4 Canterbury starts, 1 win from 5 at 1900m). The 2nd to Pleasure Artist here two weeks ago on Good ground is solid form for this. The Soft 7 upgrade suits strongly. Place probability of 85% against $1.30 place odds means the place component is marginal value at best. The win price of $3.40 (fair odds $3.57) leaves thin margin. **This is a conditional play - needs to drift to $3.80+ for meaningful EW edge.**

**Powerhouse** is the most talented runner but is a poor-value favourite at $2.30 (fair odds $2.78). He won impressively at Newcastle 1600m but faces significant query: first try at 1900m, sharp class rise to metro BM78, and a concerning soft-track record (0/2 on soft). The Tim Clark booking is a positive, but the price doesn't compensate for the risk. He's the likely winner but not at this price.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Powerhouse stamina**: Untested at 1900m and poor wet form (0/2 soft) - if he handles both, he wins easily and nothing else matters
2. **Kenmare Bay barrier 10**: Wide draw in small field on a tight Canterbury track - needs luck from the gate
3. **Soft 7 could deteriorate further**: If track moves to Heavy, field dynamics shift - benefits Kenmare Bay further but changes pace shape entirely
