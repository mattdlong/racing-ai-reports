## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Bev's Nine clearly the fastest runner on raw figures (65.84s for 1100m at Rosehill on Soft, winning BM78). Kimberley Secrets next best (63.45s Canterbury 1100m Good, BM72 win). Gap to the rest.

**Pace**: MODERATE scenario. Bev's Nine and Kimberley Secrets likely to settle on-pace. No obvious speed-on runners to set a hot tempo in a 7-horse field. Suits on-pacers, which slightly disadvantages Shalaa Gold who tends to settle midfield.

**Class**: Bev's Nine rising sharply - unbeaten in 4 starts but all at BM72 or below. First test at BM78, though quality suggests it handles it. Kimberley Secrets won BM72 last start, also rising. Shalaa Gold has prior BM72 form with 77% place strike - proven at this level.

**Bias**: Soft 7 track. Bev's Nine handles wet (2/2 soft, 1/1 heavy). Shalaa Gold has 0 wins from 3 soft starts but placed 3/3 - the place angle holds. Piastri is a noted wet-tracker (3/5 soft) but 349 days off. Kimberley Secrets 2/9 soft.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No Best Bet identified - Bev's Nine is the clear most likely winner but at $2.45 represents an underlay with -6.9% edge. The market has fully priced in the unbeaten record and J McDonald booking.

**Shalaa Gold** offers EW value at $14.00 (place $4.75). This is a confirmed STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (3.06x score) with a 77% career place rate from 13 starts. Qualifies via both Path A (EW EV +33.1%, place prob 33%) and Path B (specialist score 1.5). The 1/4 odds place return of $4.25 gives +40.3% place EV. Has won at Canterbury 1100m previously and R King is a positive booking. Only concern is 0/3 soft wins, but 3/3 soft placings actually supports the EW thesis.

## KEY RISKS

1. Bev's Nine may simply be too good - unbeaten talent with top jockey could dominate a small field
2. Shalaa Gold has 0 wins from 3 soft starts - the place angle is strong but win component is speculative
3. Jaegers is a query at BM78 off maiden/low-grade form and 70 days off, market may be overrating
