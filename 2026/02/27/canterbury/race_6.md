## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Maybe Moet posted the quickest Canterbury 1250m time (73.08s) and Mercy Me has been dominant at Gosford (61.97s for 1100m). Both co-favorites have shown the best raw times but at lower class levels.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. No confirmed leaders; Maybe Moet (bar 1) and Maquisa (bar 2) likely sit handy. Vanessi (bar 3) gets a soft run. Suits on-pace and stalking types.
**Class**: Major class rises across the field. Southern Heiress from maiden/low class to BM78. Maybe Moet from BM64. Mercy Me from provincial Class 1. Vanessi has BM72 form at this track - smallest jump.
**Bias**: Soft 7 track. No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#7 Vanessi** is the standout each-way play. She qualifies via Path A (Value Overlay: $8 >= $6, EW EV +10.3%, place prob 42%) AND Path B (Place Specialist: score 1.65). Career place rate of 60% (9/15) is exceptional. She ran 3rd last two at BM72 level by margins of 0.11L and 0.22L - the closest to BM78 proven form in this field. Barrier 3 ensures a soft run, and while Siena Grima is an apprentice, the 3kg claim is useful. Soft track form: 0 wins but 4 places from 7 starts.

**#11 Maquisa** provides EW value at $14 via Path A (EW EV +39.3%, place prob 33%). Just won maiden at Kembla on soft, and Tim Clark booked. Barrier 2 is ideal. Six Canterbury starts (no wins but knows the track) and 1w/4p on soft. The class rise from maiden to BM78 is significant (red flag) but the price compensates.

## KEY RISKS

1. Both EW selections are making class rises - Vanessi from BM72, Maquisa from maiden
2. Soft 7 track: Vanessi has 0 wins from 7 soft starts (4 places); untested ground for several runners
3. Co-favorites Maybe Moet and Southern Heiress could dominate if they handle the class rise - small field of 7

## EACH-WAY DETAIL

|-------|------|-------|--------|------------|------------|-----|
| Vanessi | A+B | +10.3% | 42% | 1.65 | $3.30 | 1.0u EW |
| Maquisa | A | +39.3% | 33% | - | $5.00 | 0.8u EW |
| Let's Go Barbie | B | +3.8% | 36% | 2.86 | $3.60 | Monitor |
