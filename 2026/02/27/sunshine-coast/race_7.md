## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Chance With Wolves rated highest on recent class-adjusted speed; won BM62 at SC by 2.6L on Good, 2nd BM65 Doomben on Soft. Clear class edge dropping to BM55.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected with limited early speed. On-pace types Rothecate and Constant Cafe may lead but lack wet form. Midfield runners advantage on heavy going.
**Class**: #8 Chance With Wolves dropping from BM65 to BM55 is the standout class drop. Hey Chardonnay has raced 0-58 class - similar level. Galactic Legend competitive at BM55 level.
**Bias**: Heavy 10 is the dominant factor. Inside barriers and proven wet trackers gain huge advantage. Rail position unknown but heavy conditions typically favour inside runners who save ground.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#8 Chance With Wolves** is the clear value play. The 7yo gelding has the best heavy track credentials in the field (1 win, 1 place from 7 heavy starts; 2 wins, 8 places from 28 soft starts). He draws barrier 4 which is ideal on heavy ground in a 14-horse field, drops significantly from BM65 class, has won 3 races at Sunshine Coast from 33 starts showing intimate course knowledge, and comes into the race with consecutive placings on wet tracks (2nd Doomben BM65, 3rd Kilcoy BM60). At $6.50 he represents genuine value against a favourite in Hey Chardonnay ($3.30) who has never won on wet ground (0 from 10 on soft/heavy).

**#11 Galactic Legend** qualifies as EW VALUE via Path B (Place Specialist). He draws the inside rail (barrier 1) which is a massive advantage on Heavy 10, has won twice on soft with 5 additional placings from 9 soft starts, and recently placed 2nd at Kilcoy BM50 and 3rd at Bell BM55. At $31.00 with place odds of $7.25, the place specialist score of 2.35 makes him a strong each-way proposition at big odds. His 39.4% career place rate far exceeds the expected rate for his win probability.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Chance With Wolves**: 7yo may not handle extreme Heavy 10 (bulk of wet form is on Soft 5-7); has been in consistent work racing every 2 weeks which could flatten form
2. **Galactic Legend**: Limited heavy track data (3 starts, 0 wins); last start was 6th at Nanango on Good - needs the wet to improve
3. **Hey Chardonnay (danger)**: Market favourite has the best raw ability; if she handles the heavy she could win on class alone despite wet track question marks
