## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited timing data on heavy ground makes speed figures unreliable; race likely run 6-8L slower than good ground par. Galeka's heavy track win at Gayndah and Zingalong's heavy 2nd suggest they handle the going.
**Pace**: SLOW tempo expected - no confirmed heavy-track leaders in this field. Double Whammy and Hereditary typically race on-pace but untested at 1400m on Heavy 10. Backmarkers may struggle to make ground on a bog track.
**Class**: Market favourite Castello Grande (3yo) dropping from CL1 but has ZERO heavy track starts - massive query. Fifth Force dropping from BM68 but 0/3 on heavy. Galeka has contested stronger country fields and handles the ground.
**Bias**: No bias data available (LOW confidence). Heavy 10 typically favours on-pace runners on inside barriers. Galeka's mid-draw (7) is adequate.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Galeka is the only runner in this field with a proven heavy track victory (1/2 on heavy, win + place). While her recent form reads modestly (x-3-7-2-6), most of those runs were on good/soft ground against stronger opposition at Doomben. She steps to a provincial BM65 on a surface where most of this field will struggle. The market has over-bet Castello Grande ($3.00) and Fifth Force ($3.10) - neither has shown any aptitude for genuine heavy conditions. At $9.50 with +14% edge and an EW EV of +11.5%, Galeka represents the best value proposition in a race where wet track form is the dominant factor.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

| Horse | Win Odds | Win EV | Place Odds | Place EV | EW EV | Rating |
|-------|----------|--------|------------|----------|-------|--------|
| Galeka | 9.50 | +14.0% | 2.63 | +9.1% | +11.5% | STRONG EW |
| Hereditary | 17.00 | +19.0% | 4.00 | +25.0% | +22.0% | STRONG EW |

Hereditary shows strong EW numbers but is WATCH only due to 121-day layoff and 0/3 on heavy track record.

## KEY RISKS

1. Galeka has never raced at Sunshine Coast (0 course starts) - unfamiliar track on a bog
2. Heavy 10 is extreme - even proven wet-trackers can flounder; race may be run at a complete crawl favouring leaders, and Galeka typically settles mid-field
