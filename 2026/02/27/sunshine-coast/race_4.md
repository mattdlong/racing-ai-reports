# Sunshine Coast R4 | 1000m BM70
Fri 27 Feb | 8:08pm | 8r | Heavy 10 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - No reliable edge identified. Heavy 10 conditions create extreme uncertainty; no runner has proven heavy-track form at this level. Favourite $1.85 is a clear underlay (-41% edge). Only mathematical value is #3 Never Say Nay at $23 (+38% edge) but 426-day layoff is a disqualifying red flag.

## FIELD ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Bar | Wt | Odds | Form | Wet | C/D | Comment |

| 1 | Trapeze Warrior | 6 | 62.0 | $8.50 | 17x6 | 0/0 hvy | 0/0 C, 3/9 D | Class drop BM78>70, untested heavy |
| 2 | King Spirit | 5 | 60.5 | $1.85 | 4635 | 0/2 hvy | 0/10 C, 2/12 D | 2 recent wins but 0/2 heavy, 0 C wins |
| 3 | Never Say Nay | 4 | 60.5 | $23.00 | x5x7 | 1/2 hvy | 0/2 C, 4/13 D | 426 days off, best heavy record |
| 4 | Outweighed | 1 | 60.0 | $4.50 | 449x | 0/2 hvy | 5/9 C, 5/14 D | Outstanding C/D but 0/2 heavy |
| 5 | Jaggery | 7 | 55.0 | $7.50 | 12x6 | 0/1 hvy | 1/8 C, 1/9 D | 3yo rising class, placed heavy |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No sectional data available. King Spirit's recent 59.76s (1050m Rockhampton Soft) and Ritualize's 67.49s (1110m Doomben Heavy) are best recent wet-track times relative to distance, but Heavy 10 will slow all times significantly.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Trapeze Warrior and King Spirit likely to push forward. Outweighed from barrier 1 can sit handy. Small field reduces pace pressure. On-pace runners slightly favoured in heavy conditions at 1000m.

**Class**: King Spirit (CL4-SW) and Outweighed (BM78 level) have highest class ceilings. Ritualize unproven at BM70 level with only a maiden win. Never Say Nay has raced at BM70 level previously.

**Bias**: No reliable bias data for this meeting. Heavy 10 track typically favours inside runners and on-pace styles at Sunshine Coast. Barrier 1 (Outweighed) and 2 (Territory Ash) have theoretical advantage.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Heavy 10 is the great unknown** - King Spirit (0/2), Outweighed (0/2), and Trapeze Warrior (0/0) are all unproven or failed on heavy. The market favourite may not handle conditions.
2. **Ritualize ($3.60) is a 2-start horse** returning from 289 days off at an untried track/distance. Heavy maiden winner but huge unknowns at this level.
3. **Market is extremely compressed** - 147% overround in an 8-horse field signals bookmaker uncertainty. No value available at current prices.

## MARKET NOTES

- King Spirit $1.85 implied 54% vs estimated 32% = -41% edge. Heavily backed despite 0/2 heavy and 0/10 at Sunshine Coast.
- Ritualize $3.60 is market's second pick based on heavy-track maiden win. Only 2 career starts makes this speculative.
- Outweighed $4.50 is the C/D specialist (5/9 at Sunshine Coast 1000m) but 0/2 on heavy and poor current form.
