## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Unfaithful posted 57.53s winning at SC on Good - fastest raw time in field. Extreme Ally's 59.14s SC win on Soft is solid for the class. On a Heavy 10, raw speed figures from good tracks are less predictive.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Unfaithful will likely lead from barrier 3. A Lot Of Booty and Revitup Charlie can sit handy. Extreme Ally typically races on-pace and can settle midfield from barrier 5.

**Class**: BM68 is the highest class most of this field has faced. Extreme Ally won at BM58 level but form at 0-58/0-55 is strong - the x,2,2,1 pattern shows rapid improvement. Unfaithful is stepping from Maiden to BM68, a significant class rise of 2+ levels.

**Bias**: Heavy 10 with rain continuing. No historical bias data available (LOW confidence). Inside barriers should benefit on a deteriorating track.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Extreme Ally** ($17.00 EW) is the value play. The 6yo mare won at Sunshine Coast 1000m on Soft 6 weeks ago (59.14s, beat 11 runners by 0.6L) and followed with a close 2nd at Gatton 1100m. Her soft track record (2 wins, 8 places from 14 starts) is the best wet form in the field. She's a proven place specialist (53% place rate, 1.70x specialist score) stepping up to BM68 but her recent trajectory (2,2,1) suggests she's racing in career-best form. At $17, she qualifies as EW VALUE through all three paths: Value Overlay (A), Place Specialist (B), and Longshot Place Value (C).

**Unfaithful** ($2.00) is the most likely winner but represents poor value. She's lightly raced (4 starts) and won impressively at this C&D, but that was on Good ground against a weak Maiden field of 5. She has ZERO wet track form - 3 starts on soft for 0 wins, 0 places. Jumping from Maiden to BM68 on a Heavy 10 is a massive test. At $2.00 with -40% edge, the market is pricing in a certainty that doesn't exist.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Extreme Ally**: 0/2 on heavy tracks (both at BM58+ in VIC) - the Heavy 10 is a significant unknown despite strong soft form
2. **Unfaithful**: Untested on heavy, massive class rise from Maiden - but natural talent could overcome both
3. **General**: Heavy 10 with continuing rain is a great leveller - track conditions favour experienced wet-trackers
