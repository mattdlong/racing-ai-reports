## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Miss Adrift has the best form figures with consistent placings at metro/provincial level (3rd SCT soft, 3rd Eagle Farm soft, 4th Doomben trial). No other runner has comparable quality.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No genuine leader identified; likely a muddling pace on Heavy 10 which should suit on-pace types. Miss Adrift and Gratification likely to sit handy.
**Class**: Weak maiden field. Miss Adrift has the strongest class profile (Eagle Farm, Doomben experience). Gratification transferred from Victorian maidens with a 2nd at Cranbourne 1400m.
**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW. Heavy 10 typically favours on-pace runners on inside barriers. Miss Adrift (bar 10) and Gratification (bar 12) both disadvantaged by wide draws.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Miss Adrift is the clear class runner with the best wet-track credentials (2 placings from 3 soft starts), but at $2.05 in a 13-runner maiden on Heavy 10, the price offers no value. Her fair odds are closer to $3.12 based on a 32% win probability estimate. The 144% market overround means the bookmaker margin is extreme. Gratification is the only realistic danger but is also an underlay at $3.60 (fair odds $5.56). Heavy 10 conditions on a provincial track with 13 maiden runners creates enormous uncertainty that isn't compensated by the available prices.

## KEY RISKS

1. Heavy 10 conditions create massive form reversal potential - any maiden could improve sharply on this surface
2. Wide barriers (Miss Adrift 10, Gratification 12) a significant negative on a wet track where inside running is typically favoured
3. Debut runners (Rubick's Shadow) and lightly-raced types could outrun odds on an unsuitable surface for formlines
