# Sunshine Coast R3 | 1000m CL1
Fri 27 Feb | 7:38pm | 10r | Heavy 10 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - No edge detected. Weak CL1 field of maiden graduates on Heavy 10. Market favourite Hello Punters ($2.45) has poor wet form (0/1 Heavy, 0/1 Soft). Best-rated Yaranga ($3.00) shows -4% edge at best - insufficient margin.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No reliable speed figures separating this field - all maiden/CL1 level with limited race data. Yaranga's Eagle Farm 1000m trial win (57.55s Soft) is the best time on record.
**Pace**: MODERATE. Likely genuine speed from Hello Punters (barrier 1, on-pace type) and Peanuts. Should be an honest tempo over 1000m with 10 runners.
**Class**: Bottom-level CL1 maiden graduates. Only Hello Punters (7 starts, 4 places) and Magic Invader (5 starts, 2 places) have meaningful race experience. Most are recent maiden winners from trials.
**Bias**: No significant bias data (LOW confidence). Heavy 10 with rain is the dominant factor - wet track specialists have a huge edge.

## WET TRACK ANALYSIS (KEY FACTOR)

- **#3 Yaranga**: Won trial on Soft (Doomben), 3rd on Soft (Eagle Farm). Wet form PROVEN. Best positioned for Heavy 10.
- **#4 Hello Punters**: 5th of 8 on Heavy (Toowoomba), 6th of 10 on Soft (Ipswich). WET FORM POOR. False favourite at $2.45.
- **#9 Head Of The River**: 2nd on Soft (Toowoomba), 3rd twice on Soft. Handles give but untested on Heavy.
- **#6 Magic Invader**: 0/2 on Soft (no places). Wet track question mark.
- **#8 Windigo**: Won trial on Good, last on Soft. Negative wet pointer.

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

- #4 Hello Punters: Score 1.32 (57% place rate) - but wet form negates this on Heavy 10
- #9 Head Of The River: Score 1.30 (50% place rate) - better wet credentials

## KEY RISKS

1. Heavy 10 with rain - track could deteriorate further, making all form unreliable
2. Very shallow form lines - most runners have 0-5 career starts, limited data to assess
3. No expert tips available (0 sources) - no consensus view to validate analysis
