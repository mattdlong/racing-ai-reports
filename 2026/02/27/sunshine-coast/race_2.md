## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No reliable speed figures available; times suggest moderate ability across field. Market compression (217%) reflects uncertainty.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Joy A Plenty and Seneschal likely to show early. No genuine leader makes pace unpredictable on the Heavy 10.
**Class**: Rustic Tzar rising sharply from BM58 to BM78 (+20pts), but Heavy 10 is a massive class leveller. Seneschal and Code In Time have proven BM78 form.
**Bias**: Heavy 10 with rain - inside barriers and on-pace runners typically advantaged. Rustic Tzar's wide barrier (9) is a negative but 9-runner field mitigates.

## EW QUALIFICATION

**Rustic Tzar qualifies via Path A + B:**
- Path A (Value Overlay): Odds $13 >= $6, EW EV +67% >= +5%, Place prob 42% >= 30%
- Path B (Place Specialist): Odds $13 >= $8, Specialist score 2.44 >= 1.3
- Place consistency: 82% career (9/11 starts in top 3)

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Rustic Tzar is the only runner in this field with a proven Heavy track victory (Casino BM58, won by 1L). The Heavy 10 conditions dramatically compress class differences, making his BM58-to-BM78 rise far less daunting than it would be on a Good track. At $13 in a market inflated to 217%, the value is enormous - fair odds sit around $7.14. His recent trial 2nd at Doomben (0.57L behind winner) shows he's fit and ready. Career place rate of 82% makes each-way the ideal approach.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (9) on Heavy track - may get pushed wide, losing ground
2. Significant class rise (BM58 to BM78) - may be outclassed even with conditions assistance
3. Only 1 Heavy track start in career - small sample
