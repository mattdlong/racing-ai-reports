## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Figures are bunched (100-105) across the field - no standout. Veight (105) and Leica Lucy (104) have highest raw figures but from weaker fields. Feroce most consistent (102, consistency 96).

**Pace**: SLOW shape predicted with no genuine leader. On-pace runners (Watch Me Rock, Veight, Buckaroo) advantaged. Closers like Treasurethe Moment and Leica Lucy will need luck to get into the race from behind in a sit-sprint affair.

**Class**: Elite G1 field. Treasurethe Moment (10/16, Memsie winner), Watch Me Rock (11/20, Railway winner), and Pericles (Tramway winner, Cantala 2nd) have the strongest G1 credentials. Veight and Feroce are rising from G3 level.

**Bias**: No detectable bias (LOW confidence). True rail. Neutral across style and barrier.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Watch Me Rock is a genuine G1 star from WA making his eastern debut. His Railway Stakes win was outstanding - winning a strong 1600m by 0.75L at Ascot with a 95.80 time. He has 11 wins from 20 starts (55%), a 90% place rate, and proven form at 1400m on Good ground (1st Asian Beau G3 1400m). He draws perfectly in barrier 1, gets William Pike (elite strike rate), and the predicted slow pace strongly favours his on-pace racing style. At $9.00 against a short-priced favourite who is coming off a 105-day break and may be caught in a sit-sprint, he represents clear value. The market appears to have underpriced his eastern credentials.

## KEY RISKS

1. First time racing at Caulfield and in Victoria - unknown track/travel form
2. Treasurethe Moment is a genuine star (3/3 at C&D, 10/16 career) and may simply be too good
