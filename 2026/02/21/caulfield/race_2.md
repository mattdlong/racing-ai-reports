## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Pallaton posted best figure in field (103) from Rubiton G3 at this course 14 days ago; Devil Night and Beskar both recorded 102-level figures from Group races in spring.

**Pace**: MODERATE - small 7-runner field with Pallaton (bar 2) and Rosberg (bar 6) likely to vie for the lead. Pallaton's brilliant early speed (won 850m by 2.54L) gives pace advantage from inside draw. No genuine speed-on outside to pressure.

**Class**: Multiple Group performers dropping to BM72 - Rosberg (G3 winner), Pallaton (G2/G3 competitive), Devil Night (G2/G3 placed). However, Pallaton the only one to have been competitive recently (0.25L off in Rubiton G3, 14 days ago). Others resuming from 130+ day spells.

**Bias**: Neutral - no significant style or barrier bias detected at Caulfield on Good 4. Rain forecast may shift conditions.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Pallaton** is the clear top pick on recent form, speed figures, and fitness. Only runner to have raced recently (14 days ago, 4th beaten 0.25L in Rubiton G3 at this track). Has brilliant gate speed from barrier 2 to control the race. Craig Williams (champion jockey) and Michael Freedman (hot stable) provide elite connections. The 1200m distance is the query (0/3 at trip, best at 850-1000m) but class drop from Group level to BM72 should compensate. At $3.50, fair value with 5.5% edge.

**Esmahli** represents the best each-way value at $8.50. Progressive 3yo with an outstanding 75% win rate (3 from 4), won BM72 last start at Rosehill. Hayes stable and Currie are a potent combination. At $8.50 with a 17% win probability, there's significant overlay.

**Rosberg** is the key horse to beat at $2.50 but is **significantly overbought**. Only 2 career starts (won McKenzie G3 then last in Danehill G2), 140-day spell, wide barrier (6), and no Caulfield form. The market is pricing reputation over evidence. True probability ~22% vs implied 40%.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Pallaton distance query**: 0/3 at 1200m - brilliant speed may not sustain the trip, especially backing up 14 days from G3
2. **Wet track shift**: Rain forecast could change conditions to Soft, which would benefit Esmahli (2/2 on Soft) and potentially disadvantage Pallaton
