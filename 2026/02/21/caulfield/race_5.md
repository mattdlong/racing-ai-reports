## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Chateau Eze has the highest speed figures (103.2 avg, 105.4 peak) despite only winning a maiden; Sheza Alibi (100.4) and Salty Pearl (100.1) proven at Group 2 level.
**Pace**: SLOW predicted tempo with no genuine leader — favours on-pace runners from inside draws; Jenni Gone Bonkers and Chateau Eze to sit handy; closers from wide gates disadvantaged.
**Class**: Sheza Alibi and Salty Pearl are the only proven Group 2 winners; Chateau Eze 2nd in Jim Moloney (G3 level) is the next strongest; Jenni Gone Bonkers faces a BM70→G2 leap.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias with LOW confidence — no meaningful adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Salty Pearl** is the value play of the race. Second-up after a solid pipe-opener (3rd Manfred Stakes, beaten 0.5L at 1200m), she has proven Group 2 winning form (Classic winner) and Group 1 experience (4th 1000 Guineas, beaten 0.35L). The step to 1400m suits — she ran a class record close 3rd in the Thousand Guineas Prelude at this distance. At $4.00, the model sees +18.7% edge against a fair price of $3.37. Hot connections (Ben Allen/Ciaron Maher) and ideal barrier 3 complete the picture.

**Chateau Eze** is the speculative value play. She has the highest raw speed figures in the field (105.4 peak from Kev Hayes 4th) and ran 2nd at this course and distance in the Jim Moloney (behind Spicy Lu, ahead of Salty Pearl). At $13.00 vs model fair value of $4.55, the edge is enormous if she can handle the class question.

**Sheza Alibi** is the best horse in the race but a terrible bet at $1.45. The 98-day spell (even with two jump outs) introduces enough risk that fair value is closer to $3.68. She needs to win ~69% of the time to be profitable — our model gives her 27.2%.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Sheza Alibi first-up**: If fully wound up despite 98 days off, she could make this a procession from barrier 1 — destroys all value selections
2. **Slow pace trap**: If the pace collapses, this could become a sprint home where class tells and the two proven G2 winners dominate
3. **Rain factor**: Track rated Good 4 but rain forecast — any deterioration helps Jenni Gone Bonkers (2 from 4 on soft) and hurts Salty Pearl (0 from 2 on soft)
