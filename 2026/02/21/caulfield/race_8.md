## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Closer To Free posted the best speed figure (92) from his Prelude win, running 63.10s for 1100m which converts to a superior 1200m projection. Unit Five's figures are harder to assess due to provincial/soft track runs.
**Pace**: CONTESTED - multiple early speed runners (Unit Five, Alibaba, Eternal Warrior) ensure genuine tempo. This suits stalkers/midfield runners like Closer To Free and Ghana's Akan who can settle and finish over the top.
**Class**: Group 1 debut for the entire field. Key lead-up form: Blue Diamond Prelude (G3) and Randwick Millennium provide the best form reference. Closer To Free's Prelude win and Ghana's Akan's Millennium 2nd are the standout form lines.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias at Good 4, rail in true position. No style or barrier advantage detected (LOW confidence).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Closer To Free** won the key lead-up (Blue Diamond Prelude) in authoritative fashion, posting the best speed figure in the field. He settled outside a leader who weakened, looked vulnerable at the 200m but dug deep and pulled away late - the hallmark of a genuine Group 1 juvenile. The Danny O'Brien colt has barrier 9 which provides options, and Michael Dee is in strong form. At $6.00 he offers clear value against a fair price of $5.56.

**Ghana's Akan** is the each-way play at massive overs. The Ciaron Maher filly was runner-up in the Millennium at Randwick (beaten 0.62L in a field of 16), has the 2kg filly's allowance, draws ideally in barrier 7, and is vastly underrated by the market at $16.00 against a fair price of $10.00. The 37.5% edge is substantial for a place-capable type.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Closer To Free** has had just one race start - limited sample size for speed figures and fitness for a Group 1 1200m second-up
2. **Unit Five** is the clear class horse (Magic Millions winner, unbeaten) and could prove too good despite the mid-barrier - the market favourite for a reason
3. **Guest House** has the dream barrier (3) and trainer Mick Price publicly stated he could be even better than scratched stablemate Big Sky - strong lurker at $5.00

## EXPERT SUPPORT

- Closer To Free: 60% (3/5 sources - races.com.au, ttrausnz, search consensus)
- Guest House: 80% (4/5 sources - most-tipped runner across previews)
- Unit Five: 60% (3/5 sources - backed as market favourite)
- Streisand: 40% (2/5 sources - fillies Prelude form)
- Ghana's Akan: 20% (1/5 sources - under the radar)
