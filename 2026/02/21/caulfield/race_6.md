*Bossy Benita's 103.3 from sprint distances; Samangu's 100.0 inflated by 1200m figure

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Damask Rose (101.0) and Bossy Benita (103.3*) top-rated but Bossy Benita's figures are from sprints. Paradise City most consistent at 1400m (97.6 consistency score). Until Valhalla lowest major contender figures (95.8).
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario with Bossy Benita and Samangu likely forward. Stalkers (Paradise City, Damask Rose, Until Valhalla) well placed. No speed-on bias to assist closers.
**Class**: Damask Rose and Benagil dropping from Group 1 to Listed - significant advantage (+10% probability adjustment each). Paradise City, Bossy Benita, and Until Valhalla all rising in class. Butternut Princess faces steepest class jump (BM70 to Listed).
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). No style or barrier advantage detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Until Valhalla** (#8) rates as an each-way value play at $8. Perfect 2-from-2 at Caulfield is the standout stat - this horse loves the track. Ciaron Maher has him peaking after a BM84 win last start, and barrier 3 ensures a soft run in transit. The class rise to Listed is the question mark, but the Caulfield affinity and Maher's placement suggest readiness.

**Benagil** (#1) offers the best edge in the race at $11. A Group 1 performer (Mackinnon, Empire Rose, Weekend Hussler) dropping to Listed level with Damian Lane aboard. The 105-day spell is the concern, but two jump outs (won the most recent) suggest fitness. The class drop is worth at least 10% probability boost, making $11 genuine each-way value.

**Damask Rose** (#5) is the most likely winner but $2.80 offers no value given 0/4 at Caulfield and 0/2 at 1400m. The C/D blank is a significant concern for a short-priced favourite.

## KEY RISKS

1. Until Valhalla's speed figures (95.8) are 5+ points below top contenders - may simply not be fast enough at Listed level
2. Benagil returning from 105-day spell - first-up record needs monitoring, form pre-spell was inconsistent (3-x-3-7-x)
3. Damask Rose's class is undeniable and Williams/Walker may overcome the C/D concerns at short odds
