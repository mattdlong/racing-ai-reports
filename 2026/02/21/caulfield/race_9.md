## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Geegees Mistruth has the best figures (98.0), 6+ pts clear. Oak Hill (91.4) and Point Barrow (92.0) are the next tier. Don't Hope Do posted 103+ figures in Oct but only 88.5 in the Rubiton.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Geegees Mistruth from barrier 1 will be prominent, Point Barrow and Gallant Son on-pace. Enough speed to suit mid-race stalkers but not a burn-up.
**Class**: Tropicus is the only proven Group 1 performer (6th in VRC Sprint, beaten 0.2L). Point Barrow has the trajectory but faces her biggest test. Gallant Son is making the biggest class jump (BM84 to G1).
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Rain forecast could soften the track — Geegees Mistruth (3 wins from 5 on Soft) and Tropicus (2/4 Soft) would benefit.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Geegees Mistruth** has the best raw speed figures in the field and draws the golden barrier 1 at 1100m Caulfield. At $8.00 she represents significant value against a short-priced favourite. Her 40% win rate and 80% place rate indicate elite consistency, and Michael Dee is a Group 1-level rider. The 0-from-6 Caulfield win record is a concern, but her 2-from-3 at 1100m and improving form pattern (3rd in the same 1000m race that Oak Hill won) suggest she's ready to break through. The 3yo weight advantage for Point Barrow (50kg vs 54kg) narrows but doesn't eliminate the speed figure gap. At 3x the favourite's odds, she's the clear value play.

**Oak Hill** at $21.00 is the value each-way play. He won the Rubiton last start, has proven Caulfield form (6 starts, 2 wins), and is the most consistent profiler in the field (speed figures of 89-94 across all 3 recent runs). Barrier 11 is the key negative but at this price, the place probability (~30%) alone generates EW value.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Point Barrow** has an outstanding profile (100% top-3 from 6 starts) and the 3yo filly weight advantage is real — she could simply be better than her figures suggest
2. **Geegees Mistruth** has 0 wins from 6 Caulfield starts — is there a track-specific issue?
3. Rain could shift track to Soft, reshuffling the form lines (benefits wet-trackers Tropicus, Geegees Mistruth)
4. Wide barriers (10-14) face a significant challenge at 1100m Caulfield — Point Barrow (10), Oak Hill (11), Jedibeel (13), Way To The Stars (14) all disadvantaged
