## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Lucky Lucky Boom posts the best raw figures (102.9 avg) but from country tracks; Crocodile (100.6) and Itazura (100.3) lead the metro-rated figures. Miss Maranda's 96.0 avg is modest but her 99.6% consistency rating is the best in the field.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected with Mr Epozino the sole genuine leader, Crocodile and Miss Maranda pressing. On-pace runners advantaged; backmarkers (Arcora, Deal Done Fast, Master Of The Air) face slight disadvantage.
**Class**: Crocodile, Master Of The Air, and Arcora all drop from Listed (Autumn Stakes) - significant class edge. Kaye Jay, Abrafo, and The Better Husband face major class rises from maiden level.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). True rail position, no significant advantage detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Miss Maranda** is the standout value play at $14.00. She won this exact race (Caulfield 1800m 3Y BM70) last start by 0.5L and has won 2 of her last 3. Her on-pace racing style is ideally suited to the moderate tempo expected, and she has the field's best consistency rating (99.6%). Despite the wide draw (15), the 1800m gives time to find position. The Moody/Coleman stable is in strong form. At $14.00 vs a model fair price of $7.80, this is a 78.6% edge - the biggest overlay in the race.

**Lucky Lucky Boom** offers speculative value at $31.00 with back-to-back wins (Sale BM66, Yarra Valley MDN). Best raw speed figures in the field but all from country/provincial - the big question is whether he can handle the metro class jump. Danny O'Brien stable running hot. At $31.00 vs fair $17.50, the 77% edge compensates for the class risk.

## KEY RISKS

1. Miss Maranda drawn widest (bar 15) - must cover ground, though 1800m mitigates this
2. Rain forecast could shift track condition toward soft, impacting Miss Maranda (Soft 1:0-0-0)
3. Single Choice ($4.00 FAV) and Our Chief ($4.40) have overwhelming expert support - market confidence may reflect information not captured by model
4. Lucky Lucky Boom faces major class rise from country to metro Saturday
