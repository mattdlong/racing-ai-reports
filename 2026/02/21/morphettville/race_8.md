*Lingani SpFig 108 inflated by heavy-track win (discounted from 118)

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sghirripa (107) and Compelling Truth (106) have the highest reliable speed figures, but both carried 61kg. Thunder Shoc's 105 at 54kg is comparable when adjusted. Lingani's 108 comes from soft/heavy conditions - discounted on Good 4.

**Pace**: SLOW shape predicted - no genuine leaders. Compelling Truth, Thunder Shoc, and Lingani likely share the front. On-pace runners heavily favoured. Wonder Boy (closer) significantly disadvantaged at -6% adjustment.

**Class**: Three runners (Compelling Truth, Sghirripa, Jack The Lad) drop from Listed level to BM68 - significant +10% class adjustment. Thunder Shoc stays at same level but already proven here with a dominant 0.9L win two weeks ago.

**Bias**: Rail out 6m, neutral bias detected. Slight disadvantage to wide barriers (11, 12, 10) offset by rail position. Thunder Shoc's barrier 1 is a major asset in slow-pace scenario.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Thunder Shoc** is the standout selection. This progressive 4yo mare won this exact class (BM68) at this track and distance just 14 days ago by 0.9L, running 69.50s. She gets barrier 1 (ideal in slow-pace scenario to slot in behind leaders), carries the minimum 54kg, and trainer Will Clarken is in strong form. The 5-4 record from 14 starts shows she's still on the improve with a 36% win rate. At $3.60 she represents genuine value with our model giving her a 24% win probability against a market-implied 27.8%.

**Sghirripa** rates the each-way play. Won the Listed Durbridge Stakes last start over 1100m at this track (beating Klabel), has an outstanding 6/13 course record, and gets the services of in-form Campbell Rawiller. The step to 1200m is the query (only 2 wins from 9 at distance), but class drop from Listed is significant.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Thunder Shoc**: Only 3 starts at 1200m (2 wins) - still sample limited. Rain forecast could shift track to Soft, which would favour Lingani/Compelling Truth over her.
2. **Sghirripa**: 2/9 at 1200m is a distance concern; his best form is 1000-1100m. Barrier 7 adequate but not ideal.
3. **Compelling Truth**: 126 days off is a significant query despite fresh form (won 2 trials). Wide barrier 11 is costly in slow pace. First time at Morphettville.
