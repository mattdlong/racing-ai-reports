*Super Lad speed figure estimated from 1600m races; no recent 1200m form.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Clarence (106) and Major Rumble (106) share the best figures, 1pt+ clear of Star Sirius (105) - Clarence more consistent run to run.
**Pace**: SLOW shape predicted - no genuine leaders, on-pace runners Super Lad and Delightful Shecky likely to roll forward but without genuine speed pressure.
**Class**: Clarence is the only runner at BM78 level; Major Rumble, Super Lad, Star Sirius, and Cork Harbour all rising 8-12pts in class - significant barrier to overcome.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (low confidence data). No style or barrier bias detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Clarence is the clear value play at $5.50. He is the only runner proven at BM78 class, carrying the best consistent speed figures in the field (105.9, 105.7 best 2 of 3). His form reads well: 3-4-2-5-3 with both recent Morphettville runs in strong BM70-78 races. The 3rd at this track/class 14 days ago (beaten 0.12L) is excellent recent form. He handles Good ground (15s: 2w 8p) and has 13 course starts for 2 wins and extensive experience. The wide-ish barrier 10 in a slow-pace race is his main risk, but the Will Clarken stable also has Yasuke (barrier 1) who may provide a lead reference. At $5.50 he offers genuine each-way value against a favourite (Major Rumble) who is rising sharply in class from BM68 level.

Major Rumble ($3.40 fav) has the talent - his BM68 speed figure of 106.1 is the single best run in the field - but he faces a 10pt class rise into a BM78 metropolitan race with only 7 career starts. His only 1200m win was at Murray Bridge in a weaker field. At $3.40 the price is too short for the class risk. WATCH only.

## KEY RISKS

1. Clarence barrier 10 in a predicted slow-pace race may leave him further back than ideal
2. Super Lad ($6.50) on winning streak with trial win is the danger if pace holds for on-pacers - but untested at 1200m in this class
