## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Ronny Bee has the best figures (104.5) by 5pts but is absurdly short at $1.85 - only 12% model probability vs 54% implied. Middle pack (Wichitall 100.2, Zarkana 99.5, Brown Nose Day Gal 99.4, Headphones 99.1) are tightly bunched.
**Pace**: SLOW predicted - no genuine leader, on-pace types advantaged (+4% probability adjustment). Ronny Bee, Brown Nose Day Gal, Wichitall, Didwewin all benefit from forward positions.
**Class**: Headphones and Zarkana dropping from BM72 - class edge. Wichitall (BM58), Didwewin (0-56), Magic Princess (BM56) all face significant class rises of 8+ points.
**Bias**: Neutral bias detected with LOW confidence. No meaningful track bias adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Headphones** at $18 represents genuine value despite moderate recent form (5-3-5-3-7). The 8yo has proven BM72+ class (dropping to BM68), draws perfectly in barrier 1, has course/distance form (4 starts, 1 win), and delivers the field's best consistency rating (94.4). At 11.2% model probability vs 5.6% implied, the edge exceeds 100%. Each-way recommended given the place strike rate (43% career) and $3.60 place odds.

**Wichitall** at $19 is the second selection. Last-start winner at 1430m Naracoorte (BM58) with good speed figures (100.2 average). Draws well in barrier 6 and on-pace style suits the predicted slow tempo. The key risk is the significant class rise from country BM58 to metro BM68, but the market appears to over-discount this runner.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Ronny Bee** could be a class above - the speed figures support it, and despite the model saying no edge at $1.85, the horse has 30% win rate and 70% place rate from 10 starts with genuinely superior figures
2. **Rain forecast** could deteriorate the track - would hurt Wichitall (poor wet form: 9th on Soft at Horsham) and potentially assist Irrefutably (1W, 1P from 2 Heavy starts)
3. **Class rise concerns** for both Wichitall and Didwewin - neither has proven at metro BM68 level
