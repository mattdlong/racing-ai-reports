# Morphettville R2 | 1800m BM62
Sat 21 Feb | 1:32pm | 8r (3 scr) | Good 4 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - No runner offers sufficient edge at current market prices. Favourite Somewhere Soon ($2.90) rates poorly on model (12.1% win prob vs 34.5% implied). Top-rated Tyusix ($3.90) is fairly priced. Longshots show theoretical edge but carry significant form risks.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Top Of The Ridge (100.2) and King Of Wessex (99.7) share the best figures, both from the same Morphettville 1800m race on 07/02 where they finished 7th and 4th respectively - beaten 3.7L. Flaming Eyes (96.2) is the most consistent performer.
**Pace**: SLOW tempo predicted with no genuine leaders. Tyusix (E1: 83) is the only on-pace runner and holds a significant tactical advantage. Back markers (Somewhere Soon, King Of Wessex, Retourne) face a genuine pace disadvantage.
**Class**: Tyusix drops from open handicap level (class rating 101) to BM62 (73) - the biggest class drop in the field by 20+ points. Flaming Eyes rises from CL2 (BM62 equivalent) so is at the right level. Hazy Daze jumps from maiden/CL1 - the biggest class rise.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). No significant track or barrier bias detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No strong selection in this race. The model's top-rated runner Tyusix (64.7) benefits from class drop and pace advantage but is fairly priced at $3.90 with a wide barrier (11). The favourite Somewhere Soon ($2.90) appears significantly overbet - lowest speed figure in the field (93.2), stepping up in class from country 0-56, and faces a pace disadvantage as a back marker in the predicted slow tempo. The three longshots showing positive edge (Enciphering, Retourne, Hazy Daze) all carry significant form concerns. Retourne has zero wins from 15 good track starts. Hazy Daze has only 5 career starts stepping up sharply in class. Enciphering has wide barrier (10) and patchy form.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain forecast could shift track condition toward soft - would dramatically change analysis (favour Retourne who has all 3 wins on wet ground, disadvantage Flaming Eyes who is 0/4 on soft)
2. Slow predicted pace could be overturned if Tyusix (wide barrier 11) elects to go forward aggressively, creating a more genuine tempo
