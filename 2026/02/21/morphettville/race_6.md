# Morphettville R6 | 1050m BM66
Sat 21 Feb | 3:52pm | 11r (4 scr) | Good 4 | Rain 6C

## ACTION

**NO BET - Market efficient on top two. Marginal EW value on Bristler but insufficient edge for Kelly recommendation. WATCH for track downgrade to Soft (unlocks Round Two).**

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Jahangir has the best raw figure (114) from Victorian form but drawn barrier 15. Bristler (110) and Round Two (109) next best with much better draws.
**Pace**: MODERATE - Bristler and Blanc Visage likely to press from inside barriers. Enough speed to ensure a genuine tempo without being suicidal. On-pace runners advantaged.
**Class**: Aztec Dancer and Runaway Belle stepping up from BM56, class query at this level. Bristler ran 2nd in BM76 last preparation - clearly the class horse.
**Bias**: Track bias neutral (LOW confidence). Inside barriers preferred on the tight 1050m course. Rain forecast could shift conditions.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Bristler** rates top on composite score (68.9) with the second-best speed figures (110), perfect rail barrier, and elite 53% career place strike rate. Two 2nds at this exact course and distance in his last three starts (beaten 0.25L and 0.76L). However, 0 wins from 10 at Morphettville is a persistent concern - he's a place horse at the track. The market has priced him accurately for win purposes at $3.80, but he represents strong each-way value given the place probability (~50%) at $1.57 place odds.

**Blanc Visage** ($3.60 fav) improved sharply last two runs - won Gawler by 1.89L, then beaten 0.01L here. Speed figures slightly lower (106) and the price offers no value. Respect but don't bet.

**If track deteriorates to Soft**: Round Two becomes the play - all 3 career wins on soft, barrier 4, solid speed (109). No value on Good 4 but live chance if upgraded.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain during the day could change track to Soft - shifts the race profile significantly (benefits Round Two, hinders Bristler's good-track form)
2. Bristler's 0/10 course win record suggests he may be unable to convert despite consistently running close
