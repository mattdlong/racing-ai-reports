# Morphettville R5 | 1050m Listed Cinderella Stakes
Sat 21 Feb | 3:17pm | 10r | Good 4 | Rain 5C

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Favourite well found; limited edge at current prices across all contenders. Juvenile race with 6 debutants creates high uncertainty.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Rebel Tuesday (101.9), La Gitana (102.0) and Image Artist (102.7) have comparable figures but all from weaker 2YO races. No speed standout at Listed level.
**Pace**: CONTESTED shape with Rebel Tuesday and Never Ordinary both wanting to press forward; favours midfield runners like La Gitana (+0.06 closer advantage).
**Class**: All runners rising sharply to Listed level. La Gitana has best prior class (G3 Chairman's Stakes 3rd) but was beaten 3L. Rebel Tuesday only proved at 2YO HCP level.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (low confidence). Rail position not specified. Rain falling but track still Good 4.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No bet recommended. Rebel Tuesday is the clear leader on form (only C/D winner in the field, 100% place record from 3 starts) but is fully priced at $2.20 with an implied probability of 45% vs our modelled 36%. La Gitana has the class form (G3 placed behind subsequent winner Big Sky at Caulfield) but $3.10 doesn't offer enough value for a filly with just one race start stepping into a Listed field. Never Ordinary's 6.77L Morphettville trial win is spectacular but trials don't always translate to race day, and $4.20 prices in much of that expectation already. With 6 debutants in a 10-runner field, this race has extremely high uncertainty that isn't adequately compensated at any price point.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain and 5C temperature could change track conditions; no wet form for any runner
2. Six debutants create unpredictable pace dynamics and form uncertainty
3. Never Ordinary's trial form may be misleading (weak trial field, no raceday pressure)

## EXPERT SUPPORT

| Horse | Sources | Support |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Rebel Tuesday | 4/4 | 100% (top pick all sources) |
| Never Ordinary | 3/4 | 75% |
| Aryna | 2/4 | 50% |
| La Gitana | 2/4 | 50% |
