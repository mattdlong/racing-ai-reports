*Trial figure only

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sassy For Sure holds the highest figure (100.6) but the top 6 are separated by just 2.2pts - a highly competitive field on raw ability.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected with Wicked Storm leading, Intellectual/Sir Myka pressing. Shape favours on-pace runners with inside draws.
**Class**: Intellectual, Sassy For Sure and Sir Myka all come out of the same BM62 race (won by Violet Lovebug in 60.76s). Intellectual finished 2nd (0.33L), Sir Myka 3rd, Sassy For Sure 4th. All rising to BM68. Wicked Storm rises from BM56 - biggest class jump in field.
**Bias**: Neutral bias with low confidence. Rail out 6m entire benefits middle-to-outside runners slightly.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Intellectual is the clear top-rated runner (75.5 composite) with the best combination of consistent speed figures (99.3 avg), ideal pace position (on-pace/pressing), strong connections (Jolly stable, Toeroek aboard), and proven course/distance record (1 win from 3 at Morphettville). The rail out 6m mitigates the wide barrier 10 draw. However, at $2.50 the market has already priced this advantage correctly - no overlay exists. Unanimous expert pick (100% of sources).

Sassy For Sure (66.8) is the main danger with the highest single speed figure (100.6) but her wider barrier and inconsistent form pattern (12th at Caulfield last prep) reduce confidence. At $5.00 she is also fairly priced.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain forecast could shift track to Soft - Intellectual has no Soft track form (0 starts), while Sir Myka (0/1 on Soft) and Wicked Storm (0/3 on Soft) are poor wet trackers. Only Zoutrail (1 win on Soft) benefits.
2. Two debutants (Mathematician, Brand Her Bold) from Clarken stable add unknown variables - market watch for late money moves.
