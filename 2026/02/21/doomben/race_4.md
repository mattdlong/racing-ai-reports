## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Headhunter has best figure (102.2), 2pts clear of field, but barrier 10 at Doomben 1600m costs significantly.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape with Italian Dancer (B1) the likely leader; on-pace/stalkers favoured - suits The Wheelbarrow from B4.
**Class**: The Wheelbarrow rises from BM65 (won well) to BM70 - manageable step. Italian Dancer makes bigger jump from 0-58/BM65 country.
**Bias**: Neutral on both style and barrier (LOW confidence), no adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

The Wheelbarrow is the clear top-rated runner - progressive 3yo with just 6 starts, won last at this track in BM65, drawn well in B4 with Michael Rodd aboard for Kelly Schweida. However, at $2.70 against our assessed fair odds of $2.86, the price represents a marginal underlay (-5.5% edge). The market has correctly identified this horse as the most likely winner. No other runner offers positive edge at current prices.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain forecast could deteriorate track - The Wheelbarrow has all 5 runs on soft (2w-3p) so would benefit, but Headhunter untested on heavy
2. Large field (12r) with wide draws for several contenders increases race chaos potential

## WATCH LIST

- **#1 Headhunter** if drifts to $6.00+ (fair odds ~$5.73) - best speed figure in field
- **#5 Italian Dancer** if drifts to $10.00+ - barrier 1 advantage + winning form, class query the concern
