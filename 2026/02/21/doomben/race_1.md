# Doomben R1 | 1200m 2YO Maiden
Sat 21 Feb | 1:12pm | 7r (6 scr) | Soft 6 | Rail +2m

## ACTION

**NO BET - Low data quality 2YO maiden. Favourite $2.20 offers no value; insufficient form data to identify genuine edge on any runner.**

*SpFig: N/A = debutant (trial form only). #5 figure adjusted for 6.73L beaten margin.*

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Doubtwilly is the only runner with a measurable race speed figure (94); all others are debutants with trial form only, making speed comparison unreliable.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape with Doubtwilly the sole genuine leader; suits on-pace runners and stalkers like Martist who can sit behind the speed.
**Class**: Level playing field - all 2YO maidens at metro level (class rating 63). No class moves to assess.
**Bias**: Rail out 2m on Soft 6; no significant style or barrier bias detected (LOW confidence). Wider barriers marginally disadvantaged.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No selection made. Martist (3 strong trials, Gollan/Maloney connections) is clearly the most likely winner at 38% assessed probability, but $2.20 implies 45.5% and offers no value edge (-7.5%). This is a classic "best horse, no bet" scenario in a 2YO maiden where data quality is inherently low. Doubtwilly is the main danger as a proven 1200m winner with pace control, but $4.60 is fair to slightly short. The remaining debutants have insufficient form data to warrant conviction bets at their prices.

## KEY RISKS

1. Track downgrade to Soft 6 (from briefing Good 4) introduces unknown wet-track variables for debutants
2. Extreme data limitation - 5 of 7 runners are debutants with trial form only; any assessment is highly speculative
