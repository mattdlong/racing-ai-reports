## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Quickzou (#4) has the top figure (107.4) off his Eagle Farm maiden win. Wootten Hyde (106.5), I'lltellyoutonight (106.0), and Fabulantes (105.4) form a tight cluster behind. Capital Chord's sole figure (105.5) is promising but unconfirmed.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No confirmed leaders - Fabulantes and Capital Chord both come from behind while Shredded can sit handy from barrier 2. Quickzou and Wootten Hyde likely mid-field. Shape suits on-pace runners from inside barriers.

**Class**: Fabulantes (76) rates highest having won a 3Y HCP here. Wootten Hyde and Certified Copy (72 each) have BM68 experience. Shredded (65) and I'lltellyoutonight (65) are the biggest class risers - both stepping from country/regional wins to metro BM65.

**Bias**: Neutral style and barrier bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position unspecified. Rain forecast may develop a soft track favouring runners with wet form - note Fabulantes (2:2 soft), Certified Copy (1:3 soft/heavy), and Capital Chord (1:1 soft).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Shredded (#3)** is the primary selection at $11.00 despite a significant class rise from country racing. The model rates him 13.0% to win against an implied 9.1% from the market (+42.7% edge). Key attractions: excellent barrier 2 draw (best in field), ultra-consistent recent form (2-x-2-2-1-1 with 83% place rate from 6 starts), light weight (55kg), and 75% expert support. The class rise is the obvious risk, but his country wins were dominant (won by 1.79L and 2.54L) and Matthew Dunn is a capable trainer making a calculated placement.

**Quickzou (#4)** rates as a marginal VALUE selection at $6.50. He holds the best speed figure in the field (107.4) and has the elite Gollan/Moor combination. The edge is thin (+11.2%) so the stake is small (0.51u). His Eagle Farm maiden win was impressive (1.47L), and barrier 5 gives him tactical options. Untested at 1350m but the step up from 1200m should suit.

## MARKET ANALYSIS

The two market leaders are significant underlays. **Fabulantes ($2.60)** rates a $6.00 chance (model 16.7% vs implied 38.5%) - the market has overreacted to his C&D last-start win. Barrier 9 is a genuine negative and top weight of 60.5kg is hard to overcome in a competitive BM65. **Capital Chord ($3.30)** rates a $7.10 chance (14.1% vs 30.3%) - exciting talent from the Vandyke yard but only one career start, widest barrier, and a big class jump.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Shredded**: Country-to-metro class rise is the #1 concern. His speed figures (101.7) are the lowest of the main contenders. If the race is truly run at BM65 metro tempo, he may be found out.
2. **Quickzou**: First time at 1350m and only 4 career starts. Thin edge (+11.2%) means odds could easily drift past value.
3. **Weather**: Rain may upgrade track to Soft, which would benefit Fabulantes and Certified Copy more than Shredded (no soft form) and could reshape the market.
