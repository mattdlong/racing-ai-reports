## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Zoubaby leads on figures (115.3 avg, 117.0 peak) with Taltarni Fields close behind (114.5). Fleetwood solid at 111.8 but 3.5pts behind the top pair.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape with Fleetwood the sole genuine leader from barrier 1. On-pace runners (Zoubaby, About To Explode) best suited. Back markers (Party Spirit, Zondee, Acres Away) disadvantaged at 1110m.
**Class**: Major class test for most of the field. Fleetwood is the only proven BM90 performer with Listed form (Falvelon). Zoubaby rising sharply from CL3/BM85 - biggest unknown. Zondee has the highest class average (96) but dire recent form.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias. Good 4 but rain around - if track deteriorates, Zoubaby (0/10 Good wins) is a query while Fleetwood (3/12 Soft, 2/2 Heavy) improves.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Zoubaby is the deserving favourite with the best speed figures in the field and a dominant C/D win last start (won Doomben 1110m by 1.73L in 63.02s). The Gollan/Moor combination is elite, and the tactical speed to sit 2nd/3rd in a moderate tempo is ideal. The concern is the class rise (CL3-SW to BM90) and a 4-from-10 record on Good tracks (prefers Soft). At $2.25, there is marginal value if we assess true win probability around 32%. **Taltarni Fields** is the value play at $9.50 with the second-best speed figures (114.5 avg), outstanding 79% place rate, and strong Doomben record (7 starts, 2 wins). The 9th last start in NMW at Doomben is a concern but can be forgiven as the wrong race shape. Excellent each-way proposition.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Rain impact**: Track currently Good 4 but rain forecast. If track deteriorates to Soft, Zoubaby's win record on Good (4/10) becomes irrelevant but Soft form (0/6 wins) is a red flag. Fleetwood (3/12 Soft, 2/2 Heavy) and Taltarni Fields (5/9 Soft) would benefit significantly.
2. **Class rise**: 7 of 10 runners are rising in class, with 4 making significant jumps (10+ points). The field quality may be overstated by the BM90 tag - this is essentially a night meeting feature race with several lower-class horses stepping up.
