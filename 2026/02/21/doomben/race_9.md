## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Pierata's Gem (106.3) leads on figures but all at sprint distances (1300-1400m) - untested at 1600m. Make A Call (105.4) and I'm Heroic (104.1) next best with proven figures at the trip.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Bengal Diamond and Aratiri likely to be forward. Make A Call to stalk. I'm Heroic and Rock Hard Love to settle mid-field. No genuine speed-on horses, which should suit on-pacers on the soft.

**Class**: Aratiri rising sharply from CL4/BM65 wins. Make A Call up from BM70. Bengal Diamond and Rock Hard Love at level (BM78). I'm Heroic rising from CL5 - the class rise is a query but soft form compensates.

**Bias**: Soft 6 track with rail out 2m. Key discriminator today. **Make A Call 0/6 on soft is a critical concern** despite top speed figure. Rock Hard Love (3/10, 100% place) and Bengal Diamond (4/13, 62%) handle it best of the fancied runners.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**I'm Heroic** at $18 represents the only positive-edge play in the race. This 4yo gelding has strong credentials on rain-affected ground (2 wins, 5 places from 10 soft starts) and the Desleigh Forster/Vlad Duric combination is a potent one at Doomben. His 2nd at Eagle Farm on soft (CL5, beaten 0.64L) was a strong run, and the 105.4 speed figure from Gold Coast on soft shows he rates when conditions suit. The last-start 10th (Doomben, Good 4) should be forgiven as a dry-track failure. At $18 in an 11-horse field, the each-way proposition is attractive with $4.00 the place.

The two market leaders - Aratiri ($3.40) and Pierata's Gem ($3.90) - are both talented but offer no value. Aratiri is progressive but rising 3 classes in one hit from BM65 and drawn widest (barrier 13). Pierata's Gem has the best speed figures but has never raced beyond 1400m.

## KEY RISKS

1. I'm Heroic last-start 10th/10 may indicate fitness concerns (despite being explainable by track preference)
2. Rising from CL5 to BM78 is a significant class jump - needs the soft ground to offset
