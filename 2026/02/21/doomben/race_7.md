## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Dominant Darcy posted 69.01s at Doomben 1200m Good (07/02), fastest in-class figure; Abender's 69.26s next best at this C/D.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected with Abender, Scripted pressing - suits on-pacers with barriers 4-5 for the top two getting ideal positions.
**Class**: Moravia has highest class ceiling (BM100 at Randwick) but 1/10 at 1200m is a red flag; Dominant Darcy rising through grades rapidly (CL1 to BM68).
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence), rain may develop some inside advantage favouring barriers 1-5.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Dominant Darcy** is the standout selection - unbeaten in 2 starts at Doomben 1200m with fast figures, 100% place record from 4 starts, and rising through the grades at speed. The Gollan yard is firing (3 runners in this race) and the step from CL1 to BM68 looks manageable given 1.88L winning margin last start. Barrier 5 ideal, 56.5kg with apprentice claim. At $4.50 there's genuine value compared to the over-bet Scripted ($2.60).

**Abender** is the each-way play at $12.00 - a proven Doomben 1200m specialist (3/5 at C/D) who won this exact race/course 23 days ago. The wide barrier 12 is the main concern, but with 7 scratchings he should get a reasonable run. Gollan-trained and in career-best form.

**Scripted** is talented and consistent but is far too short at $2.60. Model rates win probability at 28% vs 38.5% implied - the market has overreacted to a strong profile. The 7th at Gold Coast MM Cup on Soft is a concern, though Good 4 today should suit (2/2 on Good).

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain during race could shift track to Soft - Dominant Darcy's only Soft run was a Maiden win (less tested); Scripted's Good-only winning record becomes an advantage
2. Dominant Darcy's class rise from CL1 to BM68 is untested - though form margins suggest she can handle it
