# Doomben R8 | 1350m BM78
Sat 21 Feb | 5:23pm | 11r (8 scratched) | Good 4 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET - No clear edge identified in this race**

Top-rated #7 Boom Shot (72.3/100) is correctly priced at $4.00. Chief In Charge (#8) has elite course/distance form but faces class rise and pace pressure. Market is efficient on the top 4 runners. Longshots lack the class credentials for BM78 metro.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Boom Shot (#7) holds the best figures (avg 112, peak 118), 5+ pts clear. Tambo's Justice second-best (110) but at $19 for a reason - class rise from provincial.

**Pace**: FAST EARLY - three on-pace runners from barriers 1-3 (Barrelling, Chief In Charge, Boom Shot) guarantees contested speed. Leaders disadvantaged (-8%). Closers and midfield runners benefit. Boom Shot's stalking style and inside draw mitigate some pace pressure.

**Class**: Eight of 11 runners are rising in class. Only Kodiak (#2) has won at BM78 level. Ruins Of Rome (#4) and Mean Approach (#3) have competed here but without winning. The mass class rise makes this race hard to assess - many are unproven at this grade.

**Bias**: Neutral on Good 4. No material style or barrier bias detected. Rain may soften track during the day which could shift conditions.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Boom Shot (#7) rates clearly on top with a 72.3 integrated score driven by the best speed figures in the race, elite Doomben course experience (11 starts, 2 wins), and Tony Gollan training. However, at $4.00 the market has priced him correctly - our model assigns 23% win probability vs 25% implied, leaving no mathematical edge. He is the most likely winner but not a value bet. Chief In Charge (#8) has a spectacular Doomben 1350m record (3 wins from 5 starts at the course/distance) and arrives off consecutive wins, but faces a significant class rise from CL2 to BM78 and will be caught up in the contested early pace from barrier 2. Barrelling (#15, $3.30 fav) looks overbacked - rising sharply in class, a confirmed leader who will be pressured, and only 5th on speed figures.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain during the day could shift track to Soft, altering pace dynamics and favoring wet-trackers (Ruins Of Rome has 2w/2p from 4 on soft)
2. Contested pace may collapse, allowing leader Barrelling to control from rail - negating our fast pace thesis
