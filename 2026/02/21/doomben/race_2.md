## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Prince Levi and Archer's Game hold the top figures (104), but Enterprise Private's lower figure (101) comes from winning runs -- he's doing enough to win.
**Pace**: SLOW tempo predicted with no genuine leader. On-pace runners advantaged; Enterprise Private's closing style is a risk, but he has won from behind at this distance twice already.
**Class**: Enterprise Private has risen from BM66 to BM78 but already won twice at this level. Lenape Vibe makes a significant BM68->BM78 jump. Akkadian Emperor's peak class (BM80) flatters -- that was a 3rd.
**Conditions**: Track upgraded to Soft 6 with rain. Critical factor -- Prince Levi is 0/4 on soft, Akkadian Emperor 0/9 on soft. Enterprise Private 2/8 on soft with genuine wet form.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Enterprise Private is the standout play. He has won 4 of his last 5 starts including his last 3 consecutively, with 2 of those victories at today's exact 2200m BM78 level. His distance record is elite: 4 wins from 6 starts at 2200m. The Soft 6 track is a significant differentiator -- while the favourite Prince Levi has never won on soft (0/4) and Akkadian Emperor has never won on soft (0/9), Enterprise Private has proven soft-track ability (2/8). Barrier 1 is ideal for a horse that settles back and can rail-run into the straight. Daniel Moor retains the ride. At $3.70 against a vulnerable favourite, this represents a genuine overlay with ~70% expert consensus support.

Archer's Game offers each-way value at $11. He's an ultra-consistent placer (22 places from 37 starts, 59%) who ran 2nd to Prince Levi last start over 2000m at this track. His good/soft versatility (5/22 good, 3/14 soft) means the track won't trouble him, and his 2nd-place finish behind the favourite last start at BM78 confirms class.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Enterprise Private**: Slow pace hurts closers -- if no one leads, race could become a sprint from the 600m and he may not have the tactical speed from barrier 1
2. **Track condition uncertainty**: Briefing said Good 4, latest reports suggest Soft 6 -- if track improves closer to Good, Prince Levi becomes much harder to beat
3. **Prince Levi**: Despite the soft concern, he won over 2000m here two weeks ago by 1.8L and is the clear class runner
