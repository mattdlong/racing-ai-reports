## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Lord Penman has the best figures from Group-level form (Epsom/Silver Eagle); Magnatear next best from MM Cup effort.
**Pace**: MODERATE - no confirmed leader; Lord Penman, Magnatear, Kind Words likely to sit handy; race should be run evenly.
**Class**: Lord Penman (Epsom/Golden Eagle) and Thunderlips (Open Quality) the clear class standouts; Kind Words rising from BM78.
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected on Good 4; rain forecast could shift to soft which dramatically changes the complexion.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Thunderlips is the value play in a race dominated by Lord Penman's price. His soft track record (12:5-7, 42% wins) is elite compared to his good track form (12:1-3, 8%), and with rain forecast on a Good 4 surface, any deterioration transforms his chances. Second-up from a solid 2nd in the Carrington Stakes (1400m, 0.41L), he has proven BM100+ form and the Rosehill 1400m experience (1 win, 3 starts at track). At $6, the each-way market provides a safety net given his consistency.

Kind Words is a progressive mare with back-to-back wins (BM78 Rosehill 2000m, Gosford 1600m) and a Rosehill 1400m win earlier in her prep. She's on an upward trajectory and the $10 odds provide genuine each-way value, though the class rise to BM100 and 55-day gap are moderate concerns.

Lord Penman is the most talented horse but is fully priced at $2.30 - our model has him at 30% (fair odds $3.33), making him unbackable at current price despite the Waller/McDonald combination.

## KEY RISKS

1. Track stays Good 4 (doesn't deteriorate) - removes Thunderlips' key edge
2. Lord Penman dominant first-up - Waller/McDonald have a 25%+ first-up strike rate at this level
3. Kind Words class rise from BM78 to BM100 may be too steep
