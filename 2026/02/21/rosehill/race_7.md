## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Campaldino (85) has the highest raw figure but is compromised by barrier 20. Sam Hawkens (82) and Travolta (80) are the best-placed speed runners.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Piggyback and Sam Hawkens likely to be prominent from good draws. No dominant leader - suits on-pace runners who can dictate tempo.
**Class**: Significant class rise for most runners. Campaldino (Open Quality winner, Brisbane Cup) and Just Fine (Melbourne Cup runner) have the strongest class credentials, but both have major fitness concerns resuming after 250+ days.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Good 4 surface suits all running styles. No rail position noted.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Piggyback** gets the nod as Best Bet on the strength of barrier 1 (critical advantage at tight Rosehill 1900m), the mare's allowance at 53kg (lightest weight in field), and progressive form trajectory with a Colin Stephen (G3 2400m) win and two BM78 wins at staying trips. She ran 5th in the Gardenia Stakes (1600m, G2) two weeks ago, beaten only 0.13L in a 15-horse field - strong second-up form. The Ciaron Maher stable is in hot form and Dylan Gibbons has ridden her well. At $4.40, she offers genuine value against the favourite Travolta who is shorter at $3.10 despite a questionable second-up record.

**Sam Hawkens** is the each-way play. This UK import won 3 consecutive races in England (CL2-CL3, 2500-2800m range) and looked sharp in two barrier trials at Randwick, winning then running 2nd. The O'Shea/Charlton stable is building momentum and Zac Lloyd claims. The St Leger 7th (beaten 0.02L in a slowly-run race) was better than it looks. At $4.60, the each-way value is strong with place odds of $1.70.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Piggyback**: First time at Group 1 level - class rise is significant. Gardenia run was promising but she needs to replicate second-up
2. **Sam Hawkens**: First start at Rosehill, untested at 1900m, resuming after 126 days. UK form may not translate directly
3. **Travolta** (market risk): J McDonald/Waller combination with proven staying form (St Leger winner) is the likely favourite for a reason - if he runs to his best, our selections may be beaten

## EXPERT SUPPORT

- Piggyback: 75% support (3/4 sources) as top 3 pick
- Sam Hawkens: 75% support (3/4 sources) as top 3 pick
- Travolta: 100% support (4/4 sources) as top 3 pick
- Campaldino: 50% support (2/4 sources) as top 4 pick
