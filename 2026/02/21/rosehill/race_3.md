## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Bev's Nine top figure (110.1 avg, 112.4 peak) is 4pts clear of the field but penalised by wide barrier and contested pace scenario where leaders are disadvantaged.
**Pace**: CONTESTED - four on-pace runners (Bev's Nine, Stormland, Runlikenencryption, Shropshire Lad) ensure genuine tempo, favouring midfield/closing runners like Eagle Express and Sweethearted.
**Class**: Sweethearted drops from BM84 (strongest class), Stormland and Signor Tortoni rise from BM72. Several first-up/long-break runners add uncertainty.
**Bias**: Neutral (LOW confidence) - no significant style or barrier bias detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Eagle Express** scored highest on the composite model (74.3) through the combination of elite connections (J McDonald / C Waller), ideal inside barrier (3), pace-suit in a contested tempo (LP rating 61.7), and strong recent form winning at Rosehill last start. While her speed figure (102.7) is the lowest among contenders, the non-speed factors - connections, barrier, pace advantage, and won last at this track - create enough edge at $4.20 to justify a position. Expert support is strongest at 75% (3/4 sources).

**Sweethearted** offers each-way value at $13.00 dropping from BM84 class in Victoria. The highest consistency rating in the field (98.8%) and closing pace profile suit the contested tempo. No red flags apply.

## KEY RISKS

1. Eagle Express has no wins at 1100m (0/3) - all wins at 1200m+ or shorter. Distance query is real.
2. Bev's Nine is unbeaten (4/4) with the best speed figure by 4pts - if the pace isn't genuinely fast, the model's contested-pace discount may be wrong.
