## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Shiki has the best raw figures (90) from her Gimcrack and Canterbury wins; Hidrix (88) the Canonbury benchmark. Clear top-two speed horses.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected with Incognito and Dr Hook likely forward, suits the mid-field runners Hidrix and Confederation; Shiki can settle and finish over them.
**Class**: Shiki is the class act - Gimcrack Stakes winner stepping back from the Magic Millions Classic. Hidrix proved at stakes level winning the Canonbury. Confederation's debut 2nd in Canonbury was strong.
**Bias**: Good 4 with rain - track may deteriorate. No significant bias detected (LOW confidence). If track softens, Shiki has soft track form (1 from 2).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Shiki** is the highest-rated runner on our model despite being third in market. She's the class standout as a Gimcrack winner who dominated at Canterbury by 2.47L last start over 900m. The step back from 1200m (MM Classic where she was beaten as a filly vs colts) to 1100m suits, and she's proven at this distance winning the Gold Coast 1100m by 2.04L. Tim Clark is a strong booking and the Waterhouse/Bott yard are elite with 2YOs. At $4.60 she offers genuine edge over the market assessment.

**Incognito** as an each-way play at $8.50 offers value. He won the Breeders Plate earlier in his prep and while disappointing 5th in the Canonbury, that was on a moderate pace where he may not have gotten the right run. Tommy Berry retains the ride which is a positive sign, and the second-up pattern could yield improvement. Place probability of ~38% against $2.25 place odds gives strong place EV.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Shiki barrier 7** - wide draw in a 9-horse field at 1100m could mean she's caught wide without cover if pace is slow
2. **Rain factor** - track currently Good 4 but rain forecast could see it downgraded to Soft; favors Shiki's form but increases general uncertainty in a 2YO race
3. **Hidrix improvement** - the Canonbury winner may have more upside from one run and Waller juveniles often improve sharply second-up
