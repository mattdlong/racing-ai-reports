## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Emirate holds the peak figure (109.0) but terrible form; Uzziah's 105.7 avg is most consistent in the field.
**Pace**: SLOW shape predicted with no genuine leaders - heavily advantages on-pace runners (Uzziah, Monte Veebee, Transcend).
**Class**: Sweltering drops from Listed class (rating 103) to BM78 (82) - biggest class edge in the field.
**Bias**: Good 4, true rail, no significant track bias detected. Neutral conditions.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Uzziah** ($17 EW) is the standout value play. His speed figures (105.7 avg, 97.8% consistency) are the best and most consistent among on-pace runners, and the predicted slow tempo suits his natural racing style. At $17.00 he represents enormous overlay against a model probability of 12%. His 50% career place rate from 36 starts makes the each-way proposition compelling, qualifying on all three EW paths with a combined EW EV of +77.5%. The concerns are cold connections (Bourke/Aspery) and stepping from 1200m to 1300m, but his good track record (5W 10P from 16 starts on good ground) and favorable barrier 5 mitigate these.

**Sweltering** ($17 WIN) provides a secondary play with the biggest class drop in the race (Listed to BM78) and the best barrier (1). The Waller-Grima combination is steady, and the mare showed quality running 2nd in the Inglis Bracelet at Flemington. The risk is limited speed data at 1300m and a cold jockey.

**Monte Veebee** ($2.60) and **Transcend** ($4.20) are both WATCH - talented but priced too short. Monte Veebee's 73% place rate and on-pace style suit but $2.60 implies 31% when the model rates 20%. Transcend brings the best peak figure (108.8) and hot Berry/Freedman connections but is resuming from 112 days with all speed data on wet tracks.

## KEY RISKS

1. Uzziah stepping from 1200m to 1300m for the first time in this preparation
2. Sweltering resuming from spell with limited data at 1300m
3. Rain forecast could change track conditions if upgraded/downgraded
