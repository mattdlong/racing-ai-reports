## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Saytara (69) holds a marginal speed figure advantage over Viva Mauricio (68) and Defendant (67); the top 3 are closely bunched with the bottom 3 well behind.
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario likely with no confirmed leaders; small field should produce a genuine tempo without excessive pressure.
**Class**: All maidens stepping into CL1 for the first time; Saytara has the strongest recent form line (2nd at WF 1400m to winner of 84.91s) but untested at 1550m.
**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence); neutral rail position; rain may soften the track further during the night.

## PLACE SPECIALIST NOTE

**#3 Defendant** - Place specialist score 1.34 (75% career place rate vs 56% expected). Three 3rds from four starts shows extreme consistency but inability to win. J McDonald booking is a significant positive but $4.00 is too short given no win edge (-20.0%). Place EV +11.1% but EW EV -4.4% due to win component drag.

**#2 Viva Mauricio** - EW EV +4.6% (MARGINAL). Place EV +16.8% is interesting but total EW package doesn't clear the +5% threshold with sufficient confidence. Two 2nds at Canterbury 1550m is a strong course/distance profile but the $4.20 win price doesn't offer enough margin.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No selection recommended. This is a weak CL1 maiden with all runners still seeking their first win. Saytara ($2.50) is the most talented but represents poor value as an underlay (-25%). Viva Mauricio and Defendant offer marginal place value but insufficient win edge to justify EW at current prices. The field splits into two tiers (top 3 vs bottom 3) but the top 3 are too closely matched at odds that don't compensate for the uncertainty inherent in maidens stepping up to CL1.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain may deteriorate track to Soft - Saytara has 0/3 on soft, Defendant 0/2 on soft (but placed at Beaumont soft)
2. All runners are first-time at CL1 class - unproven at the level adds uncertainty
