## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Allegro Miss posted competitive times winning her last 2 at Canterbury (116.61s, 118.65s over 1900m); Centenario and Kenmare Bay have comparable figures at shorter distances but untested here.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - El Jasor and Pleasure Artist likely forward, suits midfield runners. Allegro Miss and Suit Of Armour both settle midfield and finish strongly.
**Class**: All main contenders rising from BM72 to BM78. Allegro Miss has been beating BM72 fields convincingly (1.97L, 0.39L margins). Suit Of Armour has a BM78 2nd at Warwick Farm 2400m.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Good 4 with rain - could deteriorate. Allegro Miss has soft/heavy form (2w 3p from 11 starts on wet), Kenmare Bay excels on wet (1w 9p from 12).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Allegro Miss** is the standout play. She's won her last 2 starts at this exact course and distance (Canterbury 1900m), demonstrating a clear affinity for the tight-turning 1900m trip. She's stepping up from BM64/BM72 but was dominant in both wins (margins of 1.97L and 0.39L). The 54kg weight with Jay Ford is ideal, and at $7.00 she represents +26% edge over fair odds of $5.56. Her 62% career place rate adds EW safety (+23% EW EV, +20% place EV). Rain forecast could further enhance her claims given her wet track record.

**Suit Of Armour** is a solid EW saver. He won at Canterbury 1900m on debut (Soft, 1.7L margin) and placed 2nd at BM78 level over 2400m at Warwick Farm. His 86% career place rate (6/7 starts in the placings) makes him a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score 2.08). The $9.00 offers +17% EW EV with +26% place EV.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Allegro Miss**: Class rise from BM72 to BM78 - biggest test to date. Rain could shift track to Soft where she's 2/8 (less convincing than Good form)
2. **Suit Of Armour**: Resuming from 2-year absence (last raced this distance Jan 2024). Recent runs at shorter sprints (1050-1550m) suggest fitness query at 1900m
3. **Centenario** ($3.30 favourite) has the best trainer (Waterhouse/Bott), inside barrier, and course form - if market is correct, our value picks are inflated

## MARKET NOTES

- Market % 124.9% (standard overround for 10-runner field)
- Centenario heavily backed at $3.30 (implied 30.3%) vs assessed 20% - significant underlay
- Kenmare Bay interesting WATCH at $5.50 with 2.98 place specialist score and barrier 1
