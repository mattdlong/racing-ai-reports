## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Maybe Moet has the clear best recent figures - won at Kensington 1250m, runner-up Canterbury 1250m two weeks ago; 6 lengths superior to this field on ratings.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - Lady Yarrow and Maybe Moet likely to race on-pace; no genuine leader ensures an honest tempo without extremes.
**Class**: Maybe Moet (Waller/McDonald) and Manaajem (Snowden/Collett) are the class acts; Lady Yarrow rising sharply from country CL2 to metro BM72 is the key risk.
**Bias**: Good 4 with rain forecast - no significant bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Lady Yarrow qualifies as EW VALUE via Path B (Place Specialist). Her career place rate of 73% (8/11) is exceptional, scoring 3.79 on the specialist index. She won impressively at Sapphire Coast last start (3.84L, CL2) and won her maiden by 1.37L before that - she's clearly in career-best form. At $9.50/$1.91, the place component offers +3.4% EV. The big risk is the sharp class rise from country CL2 to metro BM72, but the Waller-dominated field has only one genuine threat (Maybe Moet), and the remaining runners are modest, giving Lady Yarrow a realistic path to a top-3 finish.

Maybe Moet is the most likely winner at 42% but returns -34.9% edge at $1.55. She must be beaten to profit. James McDonald/Chris Waller combination is elite, she has proven C/D form (runner-up here over 1250m two weeks ago), and the scratching-reduced field of 8 makes her task easier. However, backing at these odds is pure negative EV.

## KEY RISKS

1. Lady Yarrow's sharp class rise (country CL2 to metro BM72) - untested at this level
2. Rain could deteriorate track further; Lady Yarrow's soft track record (2/4) is solid but Good 4 record (0/6 wins) is a concern
3. Manaajem (resuming off 230 days, Snowden stable) could improve sharply second-up at a price
