## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Caesar's 1050m trial win (63.21s) and 900m Rosehill win are strongest raw times in field. Scrumptious won Canterbury 1250m in 73.15s, a solid time at the track/distance.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - Caesar and Bryant will press forward, with Aisle Two and Scrumptious settling midfield. No genuine leader suggests even tempo suiting on-pacers.
**Class**: Caesar the clear class horse - 100% place rate from 3 starts, won BM64-level trial at Randwick resuming. Rising from maiden/barrier trial form to BM72 is significant for several runners. Aisle Two steps up from provincial Class 1.
**Bias**: No significant bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position unknown. Neutral assessment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Caesar** (#4, $2.70) is the deserved favourite with by far the best form credentials - 100% place rate, J McDonald aboard, barrier 1 at Canterbury, and the Snowden stable in strong form. However at $2.70 he represents an UNDERLAY (-5.5% edge). We cannot recommend a win bet at this price despite his clear superiority.

**Scrumptious** (#7, $11.00) qualifies as EW VALUE via Path B (Place Specialist). She won at Canterbury 1250m just two weeks ago (73.15s, Good), beating a maiden field by 0.22L. Tim Clark retains the ride. Career place rate of 50% from 6 starts is elite. At $11.00 she offers +10% edge on the win component, and the place specialist score of 2.08 supports consistent placings. The step from maiden to BM72 is a concern but Canterbury C&D winner status is a positive.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Caesar short price**: Most likely winner but no value at $2.70 - if he drifts to $3.50+ pre-post, reassess for win bet
2. **Scrumptious class rise**: First run in BM72 company after maiden win - the gap may be too large
3. **First-up runners**: Is It Spectacular (275 days), Caesar (111 days), Reflect (132 days) all resuming with query on fitness
