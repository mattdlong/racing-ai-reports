## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Fast Track posted the strongest recent figures - a dominant 2.8L win at Kembla (CL1, 1400m, soft) and close 3rd in BM64 prior. Class and form trajectory clear of field.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected in a 6-horse field. Fast Track settles midfield and has strong late speed. Throttle Response is a natural on-pacer at 1550m+ who grinds well.
**Class**: Fast Track rising from CL1/BM64 provincial wins to metro BM72 - form progression supports the rise. Sister Daae has raced at this level but 0/3 on good tracks. Soverato is a maiden winner with only 2 starts, big step up.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). No significant style or barrier advantage detected. Good 4 with rain - may shift soft during meeting.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Fast Track** is the top selection on form trajectory. Won by 2.8L last start at Kembla in CL1 grade on soft, was 3rd prior in BM64, and has been placed at 5 of last 6 competitive starts. The O'Shea/Charlton yard targets these mid-week metro opportunities off provincial wins. Barrier 5 is ideal in a small field. At $3.60, there's marginal overlay against a fair price of $3.33 (+8% edge). The favourite Sister Daae ($2.20) is significantly overbet - her good track form reads 0 wins from 3 starts and she's been disappointing since resuming, with a 7th at Randwick last start.

**Throttle Response** offers Each-Way value at $8.00 via Path A (EW EV +24.6%, place prob 47%). He's been ultra-consistent through QLD (2nd Eagle Farm CL1, 2nd Doomben BM68, 4th Gold Coast CL2) and his 4th at Newcastle BM64 last start was only 0.17L off the winner. Waller/Collett combination adds confidence. The +20% win edge with strong place probability makes the EW play compelling.

## KEY RISKS

1. Fast Track untested at Canterbury and first run at 1550m (1/1 at 1600m was a 7th, 2.8L off, at BM64 Kembla - but that was 10 months ago)
2. Rain during meeting could shift track to soft - favours Sister Daae (1/5 soft, 2nd twice) over Fast Track (2/6 soft but all wins on soft)
3. Soverato is the unknown - only 2 career starts but won a maiden by a nose at 1500m. Waller filly with upside could be anything at the price
