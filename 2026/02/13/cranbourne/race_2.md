## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figures in a field of debutants and lightly-raced maidens. Cinturato's Caulfield GNEAS run (6th of 7) and Costa Paros's close 2nds at Cranbourne are the best form references.
**Pace**: MODERATE - no confirmed leaders, likely to be controlled up front. Small field of 7 should see an even tempo. Suits on-pacers and midfield runners.
**Class**: All maidens with limited form. Cinturato has raced at Caulfield (GNEAS) which is the highest class exposure. Costa Paros has the most race experience (4 starts) with consistent placings.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (low confidence). Good 4 with rain - monitor for track deterioration.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Sonic Belle (#8)** represents the best value at $12. A Hayes-trained debutante with a strong trial profile - won a jump out, then 2nd in a Caulfield Heath maiden trial (0.75L off winner in 60.91 for 1000m). The step to 1400m on debut is a query, but Hayes runners are typically well-educated and Michael Dee is a significant jockey booking for a provincial maiden. The $12 offers +20% edge and strong EW value (18.1% EW EV). The market is heavily skewed towards Cinturato at $1.45, which looks unders given only 2 career starts (3rd and 6th) and 146 days between runs.

**Cinturato (#1)** is the clear market leader but at $1.45 represents a -34.8% underlay. Only 2 starts for a 3rd at Sale (1100m) and 6th at Caulfield (1400m). The 146-day layoff is a significant concern. The market is pricing reputation and trial form over demonstrated raceday ability. Not value at the price.

**Costa Paros (#2)** is fairly priced at $5 with 0% edge. Most experienced runner with consistent placings (2nd last start at Cranbourne 1500m, beaten 0.25L). EW value exists (11% EW EV) but no outright win edge. WATCH only.

## KEY RISKS

1. Sonic Belle is stepping from 1000m trials to 1400m on debut - stamina untested
2. Cinturato may have trialled brilliantly (won JO 19/01, we lack trial detail) and the $1.45 is justified
3. Rain could deteriorate track beyond Good 4 - no wet form references for any runner
