## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Headbanger has the clear best times (57.59s/1000m at Sandown, 58.44s at Cranbourne); Invincible Lover next best (59.22s at this track). No other runner has comparable 1000m form.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - small field with no confirmed leaders. Headbanger and Invincible Lover both raced handy, should settle on-pace. Suits on-pacers.
**Class**: All maidens, level playing field. Headbanger has the strongest class form (placed in 2YO Open Hcp at Hawkesbury, ran at Randwick). Transfer from NSW Begg stable adds intrigue.
**Bias**: No significant bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position not stated. Rain falling - monitor for track downgrade.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Invincible Lover (EW) offers the best value proposition in this race. While Headbanger is clearly the most talented runner with superior speed figures and consistency (3 placings from 4 starts), the $1.55 price implies 65% probability against our assessed 40% - a massive 38% underlay. Invincible Lover ran 2nd at this track and distance (Cranbourne 1000m, 0.4L off winner) and finished a close 4th at Pakenham 1100m (0.2L off 3rd). Barrier 2 is a significant advantage in a 7-runner sprint. The EW EV is +8.4% with place EV of +17.7%, making each-way the optimal bet type.

## KEY RISKS

1. Headbanger is vastly superior on form and could win by daylight, making place money the realistic target
2. Rain falling - if track downgrades to Soft, Headbanger's only Soft run was 7th (negative), but Invincible Lover is untested on wet
