## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Conchiero has the benchmark figure (83.02s Caulfield BM70), but Bons To Riches clocked 83.76s winning BM66 at Pakenham and 77.63s winning 1300m at Cranbourne - faster on par adjustment. Hot Digity Boom's 82.2s at Flemington BM74 is the raw best but beaten 0.75L.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No clear leader in the field - Warrior Within and Conchiero likely to settle on pace. Suits on-pacers and stalkers. Bons To Riches from barrier 1 can get a lovely run in transit.

**Class**: Three runners rising from BM66 (Bons To Riches, Hot Digity Boom, Warrior Within). Bons To Riches has the strongest trajectory - 3 wins from last 5 including BM56->BM62->BM66 progression. Princess Que dropping from BM74 but untested at 1400m.

**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. No strong style or barrier bias detected at Cranbourne tonight.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#3 Bons To Riches** is the standout value play at $7.50. Three wins from last five starts shows a horse in superb form on an upward class trajectory. Michael Dee rides and barrier 1 ensures an economical run - critical in a 9-runner field where inside runners get the shortest path. Course specialist (2 wins from 3 at Cranbourne) with a perfect 1/1 record at 1400m. The +35% edge with strong EW value (+35.1% EW EV) and a place specialist score of 1.93 make this the clear play. The class rise from BM66 to BM70 is the only concern but the form trajectory supports it.

**#10 Warrior Within** at $21 offers speculative EW value. Three wins from six career starts with C&D form (won BM66 at Cranbourne 1400m last start in 83.68s). The huge class rise from BM66 and widest barrier (14) are significant negatives, but perfect place consistency (100%) at short career underpins the each-way case. Place specialist score of 5.21.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Bons To Riches**: First start at BM70 - class rise may find horse out. Only 1 start at 1400m despite winning it.
2. **Conchiero**: Heavy favourite at $2.70 with Gai Waterhouse/Bott. If the stable has this horse ready 2nd-up after a strong Caulfield 2nd, he could dominate. Our model says UNDERLAY but the market respects this horse.
3. **Rain**: Weather is rain - track may deteriorate. Princess Que (4 wins/4 places from 4 soft) and Le Ferrari have better wet form than Bons To Riches if track shifts.
