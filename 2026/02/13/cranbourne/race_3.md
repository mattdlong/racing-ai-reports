## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: American Wolf has the best time-based figures from Caulfield BM84 (152.76s/2400m, 0.15L off) and Flemington BM78 runs. Clear speed superiority over the field.
**Pace**: SLOW tempo expected with only 4 runners and no noted front-runners. Likely a sit-sprint affair which could compress the field and reduce American Wolf's margin of superiority.
**Class**: American Wolf is the only runner with proven BM84 form. Urban Outlook (BM70 LW), Mozu Marcassin (BM66), and Midnight Glow (mixed BM66-78) are all rising significantly in class.
**Bias**: Neutral - no significant track bias detected at Cranbourne. Low confidence in bias data.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

American Wolf is clearly the best horse in the race with proven BM84 form, good record on Good ground (2/9, 6pl/9), and a recent close 3rd at Caulfield 2400m BM84. However, at $2.10 he is a significant underlay - fair odds are closer to $2.38. The 4-runner field after 3 scratchings compresses the market and eliminates place betting opportunities. No value exists in this race at current prices.

## KEY RISKS

1. Tiny field (4 runners) - anything can happen, results become less predictable
2. American Wolf untried at 2600m on a tight Cranbourne track (won 2800m at Flemington but different configuration)
3. Urban Outlook won last by 2.75L at 3000m - genuine staying ability could trouble the favourite if pace is slow enough
