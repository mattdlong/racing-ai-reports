## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figure in the field; all last preps were moderate. Shoeless has the best 1600m credentials with 5 wins from 16 starts at the trip and a BM74 win at Moonee Valley.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected with no genuine leader. Astral Flame and Time Allowed likely to sit midfield. Jareth (barrier 1) and Shoeless should get favorable positions.
**Class**: Three-way market (Astral Flame, Jareth, Time Allowed) all around BM70 level with limited separation. Shoeless drops from BM78 company, Fulfilled drops from BM78 but has been well beaten recently.
**Bias**: No significant track bias detected at Cranbourne (LOW confidence). Neutral rail position.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#1 Shoeless** is the primary EW selection at $11. He's a proven 1600m performer (5/16) dropping from BM78 company with strong course experience (1/5 at Cranbourne). His 72% career place rate makes him a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score 2.14). The EW EV is +37.7% with place EV of +43.5%, qualifying via both Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist). The market top 3 are all underlays on our assessment - Jareth ($2.70) is resuming from 145 days off with poor good-track form (1/2), Astral Flame ($3.40) has never raced 1600m, and Time Allowed ($3.50) is an untested UK import with only 4 career starts.

**#7 Jewel Bay** is a secondary EW play at $11 as a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score 1.93) with a 54% career place rate, though the 1600m distance is an untried query (0/0). The EW EV is +16.2%.

## KEY RISKS

1. Shoeless' recent form is poor (9th at Caulfield BM70) and hasn't fired since August wins
2. Market principals may have legitimate upside we're discounting - Jareth ran 2nd in BM78 at 1800m last prep, Time Allowed is lightly raced with ceiling unknown
3. Jewel Bay has never raced beyond 1400m - the 1600m is a genuine query

## EW QUALIFICATION DETAIL

**#1 Shoeless ($11 EW)**
- Path A: Odds $11 >= $6, EW EV +37.7% >= +5%, Place prob 41% >= 30% - QUALIFIED
- Path B: Odds $11 >= $8, Specialist score 2.14 >= 1.3 - QUALIFIED
- Place specialist: STRONG (2.14x expected)
- EW EV score: 85.6/100

**#7 Jewel Bay ($11 EW)**
- Path A: Odds $11 >= $6, EW EV +16.2% >= +5%, Place prob 35% >= 30% - QUALIFIED
- Path B: Odds $11 >= $8, Specialist score 1.93 >= 1.3 - QUALIFIED
- Place specialist: STRONG (1.93x expected)
- EW EV score: 74.5/100
