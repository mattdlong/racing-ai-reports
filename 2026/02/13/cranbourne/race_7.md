## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Nostro Roccia (84.72s/1400m) and Topmost (84.24s/1400m) posted the best Cranbourne 1400m times; Rock Them Jools rated on 1300m Sandown form (77.65s).
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - no obvious leader, Florina Region and Rock Them Jools likely sit midfield, suits on-pace types.
**Class**: All top contenders rising from maiden/lower grades to BM66. Rock Them Jools has prior BM66 experience (6th Bendigo). Nostro Roccia and Topmost are first-up at this level after maiden wins.
**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position unspecified. Neutral assessment applied.

## PLACE SPECIALIST NOTE

**#3 Topmost**: Career 10 starts for 1 win and 9 places (90% place rate). Place specialist score 2.50 (STRONG). However, at $5.00 the EW EV is -16.5% - no value in the odds. The place consistency is already priced in by the market.

**#5 Ryanman**: Place specialist score 2.08 via Path B ($8+ odds, specialist >= 1.3). Marginal EW value only - not enough edge to recommend.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Nostro Roccia represents the best value in this race at $6.50 each-way. Won his maiden impressively at this track and distance (Cranbourne 1400m) by 0.75L three weeks ago. The Busuttin/Young stable has him fit and the Damian Lane-ridden favorite Rock Them Jools ($2.60) looks short given his 4th at Sandown last start at only CL1 level. Nostro Roccia's place probability of 46% combined with his $6.50 odds delivers +6.5% EW expected value via Path A qualification. The wide barrier (10) in a 10-horse field is the key concern.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (10) - must use energy early or settle back, tactical disadvantage
2. First run at BM66 after maiden win - class test is genuine, untested at this level
3. Rain forecast - all good track form, heavy track record 0/1 for Nostro Roccia
