# Sunshine Coast R3 | 1000m BM68
Fri 13 Feb | 7:38pm | 8r | Good 4 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - No runner presents sufficient edge at current market prices. #5 Bonfire Spark is significantly overbet at $2.80 (fair odds $5.56). #3 Admitted is the quality runner but $4.20 offers no overlay.

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

| # | Horse | Plc Rate | Expected | Specialist Score | EW Rating |
|---|-------|----------|----------|------------------|-----------|
| 6 | A Lot Of Booty | 55% | 22% | 2.55 (STRONG) | -3.1% EW EV |
| 4 | Limero | 54% | 24% | 2.25 (STRONG) | -32.6% EW EV |

Both are strong place specialists but neither offers EW value at current prices.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: #3 Admitted has the best competitive 1000m time (57.34s at SC Good in BM70), though from a small field. #2 Super Daisy has track speed (ran in 57.28s BM78 race) but finished last. Raw times are compressed across the field - no standout figure.

**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected. No confirmed on-pace runner. #3 Admitted and #4 Limero likely to sit midfield. #5 Bonfire Spark's pattern unknown at this trip after a long break. Inside draws (#2, #4) advantaged in an 8-runner field at 1000m.

**Class**: #3 Admitted showed ability at BM70 level (3rd) and won trials impressively (by 5.23L). Stepping to BM68 is appropriate. #5 Bonfire Spark rising from CL1/BM58 level with only a trial win to suggest readiness - significant class test. #2 Super Daisy has BM78 experience but has been well beaten in 6 consecutive race starts.

**Bias**: Neutral (LOW confidence). No rail position data. Good 4 track with rain forecast could deteriorate - monitor.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

#3 Admitted is the quality runner with best recent competitive form (2nd, 3rd at BM68-70 level), strong trial performances, and is improving at 4yo. However, the market has priced this correctly at $4.20 with fair odds calculated at $4.55 - insufficient overlay for a bet. #5 Bonfire Spark is a false favourite at $2.80 with form figures of 6-8-7-7 in races and only a trial win (small field at Beaudesert) to recommend. The market is over-reading the trial performance and trainer intent.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain could change track condition significantly - all assessments based on Good 4
2. #5 Bonfire Spark could improve sharply first-up for new campaign despite poor race form - trial win was impressive (2.84L)
3. Thin race with no clear standout - vulnerable to any runner producing a career-best

## MARKET NOTES

- Market overpercentage: 126.2% (typical for provincial)
- #5 Bonfire Spark absorbing 35.7% of implied probability at $2.80 - looks too short
- Value gap: If #3 Admitted drifts to $5.00+ or #2 Super Daisy firms below $8.00, reassess
