## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figures in this field. Spot The Aussie ran closest (5.1L off at Ipswich 1700m soft) but still well beaten. Every runner is a maiden.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. With only 7 runners and no confirmed on-pacers, likely a genuinely-run affair at moderate tempo. Barrier 1 (Evade The Game) and barrier 2 (Promises Made) can slot in without pressure.

**Class**: Extremely weak CL2 field. Zero winners among all 7 runners. Combined career record: 0 wins from 52 starts. This is effectively a 1800m maiden with prize money of just $442.

**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. Good 4 surface with rain around - monitor for potential soft upgrade which would favour Spot The Aussie (2 places from 3 soft starts).

## CONTENDER NOTES

**#6 Spot The Aussie ($2.35 FAV)**: Best form credentials - 3rd at Ipswich 1700m (soft, 5.1L off) last start and 2nd at Deagon trial. Vandyke/Thompson combination adds appeal. BUT: 0/5 career, stepping to 1800m first time, wide barrier 10 in 7-runner field, and $2.35 implies 42.5% vs our 30% estimate. Significant underlay.

**#3 Galway Flyer ($3.00)**: Waller-trained, previously raced in stronger Sydney maidens (Newcastle, Canterbury). Moving to weaker QLD provincial but still hasn't placed in 4 starts. 6th of 14 at Newcastle 1850m is a form line but $3.00 is too short for a 22% chance.

**#10 Promises Made ($4.00)**: Another Waller runner, only 2 career starts. 4th at Doomben 1650m (soft, 4L off) was OK. Stepping to 1800m untested at distance. Barrier 2 helps. Upside runner but $4.00 implies 25% vs 18% estimate.

**#7 Evade The Game ($5.50)**: Best draw (barrier 1), 4 Sunshine Coast starts (0-1-0), knows the track. 4th last start at 1600m here (10.3L off) but 3rd two starts back at 1600m. Stepping to 1800m is the query. Fair odds around $7.14.

**#5 Cooloundra ($19)**: Only 1 career start (7th Ipswich 1350m soft, 13.1L). Vandyke-trained 3yo stepping to 1800m second-up. Speculative but $19 offers some mathematical edge if 7% win probability is accurate. Too little data to be confident.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Entire field are maidens** - no proven winners, form unreliable, high variance race
2. **Market is compressed** - favorite at $2.35 in a maiden where every runner has failed to win, poor risk-reward
3. **Weather variable** - rain around could change track condition and reshuffle form lines
