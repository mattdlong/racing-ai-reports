## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Revitup Charlie (57.74s/1000m Dalby) and Loken (46.35s/800m Kilcoy) have the quickest recent clockings, but both underlaid at current prices. Capiana won at Gympie 1170m in 70.22s (BM50) suggesting she can rate and sustain.

**Pace**: MODERATE - Loken and Revitup Charlie likely to press forward from mid-draws. Capiana (bar 3) can settle handy without spending. No dominant leader, suits on-pace runners who can sustain.

**Class**: BM58 provincial. Revitup Charlie rises from 0-55 Dalby win. Loken rises from BM55 Kilcoy win. Capiana won BM50 and placed BM60 - appropriate level. Key class movers are Revitup Charlie and Loken stepping up from country wins.

**Bias**: Neutral. Track bias confidence LOW. No significant style or barrier bias detected. Good 4 with rain may shift to soft during night session.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Capiana offers genuine each-way value at $9.50. Her 44% career place rate (4 placings from 9 starts) against an expected 29% makes her a strong place specialist (score 2.32). She won impressively at Gympie by 7.5L (maiden) and followed with a BM50 win and BM60 third. The 14-day back-up from Dalby (6th, beaten 0.86L in BM55) is acceptable - that was a competitive race won by Revitup Charlie. Good barrier (3) allows her to settle handy. The market has her at $9.50 (implied 10.5%) against our assessed 12% win probability, creating +14% win edge and +12.4% EW EV.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain during night session could shift track to soft - Capiana is 0/2 on soft with no placings
2. First start at Sunshine Coast 1000m (0 from 3 at 1000m, better over 1170m)
3. Market has clear opinion on Revitup Charlie ($3.50) and Loken ($3.90) - both more exposed
