## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Poutchek ran the best recent race (5th, 0.12L off BM65 winner at Eagle Farm) but 0/8 at the distance is concerning. Brutal Bowler competitive at this level consistently.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected with no confirmed leaders; Parisienne Piper and Brutal Bowler likely to settle midfield. Should suit on-pace runners.
**Class**: Poutchek is the class drop ($3 FAV, BM65 to BM62) but is far too short given 6% win rate from 18 starts. Parisienne Piper rising from maiden win but showed ability (97.13s at track/distance).
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Good 4 track with rain around - may deteriorate. No barrier or style bias detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Brutal Bowler at $5.00 EW presents the only quantified value in this race (+10% win edge, +11% EW EV). Course winner with 4 starts at Sunshine Coast. The key is that this horse offers genuine each-way value with a 56% place probability against place odds of $1.73. While recent form (7-7-4) is plain, the margin gaps have been closing and this is a weak BM62 field. Poutchek ($3) is a significant underlay - fair odds $4.17 - with zero wins from 8 starts at 1600m despite consistent placings.

## KEY RISKS

1. Brutal Bowler is 0/7 on good tracks (better record on soft) - if track stays firm, this is a concern
2. No 1600m form on record for Brutal Bowler (distance untested)
