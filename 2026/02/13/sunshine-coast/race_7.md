## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Vancity and Hell Follows set the standard - Vancity won BM58 2200m SC last start (139.32s), Hell Follows close 4th in CL3 1600m SC (0.18L off winner).
**Pace**: MODERATE - Vancity and Hell Follows likely to take forward positions from inside draws. Suits on-pace runners. No genuine speed-on in a 7-horse field.
**Class**: All runners competing at or near BM58 level. Vancity comes off a win at this grade. Xtra La Vita untested at 1800m in open company, dropping from CL1 metro.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). No significant track bias detected. Rain may soften track during meeting.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No strong win value identified in this race - the market has the two principals (Vancity and Hell Follows) about right. **Slugworth** qualifies as EW VALUE via the Place Specialist pathway: 46.2% career place rate (6/13) against an expected 28% for a 10% win probability runner in a 7-horse field (specialist score 1.65). Won his maiden at 1800m Gold Coast on soft, and ran a solid 3rd at Gatton 1600m last start. The $10 price provides adequate each-way margin with place odds of $4.00. Wide draw (11) is manageable in a small field.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Slugworth**: Wide barrier (11) could burn energy in the run; only 1 win from 13 starts suggests limited ability at this level
2. **Rain factor**: Track listed Good 4 with rain - could deteriorate to soft, which would shift advantage toward Vancity (0/19 on soft) away and toward Slugworth (1/7 on soft)
