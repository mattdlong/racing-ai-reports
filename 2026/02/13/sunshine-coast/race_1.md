# Sunshine Coast R1 | 1200m Maiden
Fri 13 Feb | 6:38pm | 4r (2 scr) | Good 4 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET - All runners UNDERLAY in overround 4-horse maiden. Insufficient edge and low data confidence (2yo debutants, trial-only form).**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Fair | Win% | Edge | EW EV | Tier |

## FIELD ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Bar | Wt | Trainer | Jockey | Form | Notes |
|---|-------|-----|----|---------|--------|------|-------|
| 4 | Gold Czech | 2 | 58 | L Birchley | J Guthmann-Chester | 10614 | FAV. 2 trial wins inc. beat #3. Only race start 6th in MM 2YO Classic (stronger class). 55 days between runs. Stepping to 1200m first time. |
| 6 | Sniper Boom | 3 | 58 | P Butterworth | B Thompson | 23 | Only runner with race-day form - 2nd Eagle Farm 1200m (beaten 1.93L). Proven at distance. 13 days since last. Best jockey booking. |
| 3 | Gin 'N' Juice | 1 | 58 | B Healey | C Graham | 2(t) | 2nd to Gold Czech in trial (beaten 0.41L). Rail barrier advantage. Debut - no race-day form. |
| 2 | Do A Little Dance | 5 | 58 | B Healey | G Cartwright | 3(t) | 3rd in trial (beaten 1.16L). Widest barrier. Least exposed of runners. |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No race-day speed figures calculable - all form is from trials (untimed officially). Gold Czech's Eagle Farm-bound trial rival Sniper Boom ran 71.77s for 1200m which is modest.
**Pace**: With 4 runners and all largely untested, pace scenario is unpredictable. Gold Czech and Sniper Boom have shown early tactical speed in trials.
**Class**: Provincial 2yo maiden - bottom rung. Gold Czech's single race start was in a tougher Magic Millions class (ran 6th/9). Only Sniper Boom has competed at race level at this distance.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (low confidence). Rail position not specified. No meeting results to assess.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Gold Czech is the deserved favourite with two trial wins and a race start at a higher level, but at $1.95 in a 4-horse field with 121% market percentage, there is no value. The market is pricing him at a 51% implied probability vs my estimate of 40% - a significant 22% underlay. Sniper Boom is the most interesting runner with proven race-day form at the distance and marginal EW value (+2.3%), but insufficient to recommend in a field paying only 2 places.

## KEY RISKS

1. All runners are 2yo debutants/lightly raced - trial form is unreliable and improvement curves are unpredictable
2. Rain weather may deteriorate track conditions from Good 4, adding further uncertainty
3. 121% market overround in a 4-horse field makes value extraction extremely difficult

## PLACE VALUE NOTE

Sniper Boom shows 77.2% place probability vs $1.91 place odds (implied 52.4%) = place edge exists (+17.7% place EV). However, this alone doesn't justify a bet without a structured place-only market.
