## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Nkosi returns from 132-day spell with BM88 winning form; Aroha Stone progressive mare won last at 1500m Soft.

**Going**: Critical factor - Soft 5 with rain. Nkosi excels (6:3-3 Soft/Heavy), Aroha Stone solid (11:2-6). Lancelot Du Lac has ZERO Soft form - major query on favorite.

**Class**: Both selections have proven at or near BM88. Nkosi won at this level at Rosehill (1800m BM88). Aroha Stone rises but handles wet.

**Pace**: Expect MODERATE tempo with no confirmed leaders. Barrier 2 (Nkosi) and 5 (Aroha Stone) can settle midfield with cover.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**NKOSI** represents outstanding each-way value at $11. Returns from a 132-day break but has won fresh before (1/1 on Heavy). His BM88 credentials are proven (won at this level Sept 2025), and his Soft/Heavy record of 6:3-3 is exceptional. The market has dismissed him due to the layoff, but Bjorn Baker has him well placed with Dylan Gibbons booked.

**AROHA STONE** is a progressive 4yo mare with 60% place strike rate. Won last at 1500m on Soft track (92.19s), now stepping to 1600m which suits her staying profile. The market underestimates her wet-track ability and she offers excellent place value at 1/4 odds of $13.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Nkosi**: 132-day layoff - fitness query despite good fresh record
2. **Aroha Stone**: Class rise from BM68/CL4 level to BM88
3. **Lancelot Du Lac**: If track improves, his class may prevail despite no Soft form

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

The market has over-bet:
- **Unleeshing ($2.45)**: Single dominant win inflating price; wide barrier 10 a concern
- **Lancelot Du Lac ($3.10)**: Zero Soft track runs - massive query at Soft 5 with rain

The market has under-bet:
- **Nkosi ($11)**: 54% overlay with exceptional wet-track credentials
- **Aroha Stone ($13)**: 56% overlay, consistent placer with wet ability
