## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Lady Olenna won last start Canterbury 1200m (Soft) by 0.75L in good time (71.20s). Rose Aye has 78% career place rate with consistent minor placings.

**Class**: Both selections have proven at this BM72 level. Autumn Break (#12) is making a massive class rise from country maiden/CL2 - fair odds $4.50+ not $2.35.

**Pace**: Large field with genuine speed engaged. Wide barriers (11-24) will be disadvantaged. Inside draws (1-10) hold advantage.

**Conditions**: Soft 5 track suits Lady Olenna (2 wins, 3 places from 5 soft track starts). Rose Aye also handles give (1 win, 2 places from 4 soft starts).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Lady Olenna** - Last start winner who broke through at Canterbury 1200m on a soft track just 14 days ago. The 4yo mare has shown consistent form this prep (1-2-5-6-4-1 last 6 starts) and gets a winnable barrier 12 in this large field. Aaron Bullock retains the ride. At $15 she represents exceptional each-way value with a 24.6% place probability. The class is appropriate (won Highway C3 and 2nd in Highway C2) and the soft track is ideal.

**Rose Aye** - Elite jockey James McDonald takes the ride on this consistent mare who has placed in 7 of 9 career starts (78%). Last start won at Wagga 1200m before finishing 7th in a Highway but the step back to BM72 suits. Soft track form is solid. At $10 with place odds of $2.80, the EW value is strong (+9.7% EW EV).

## KEY RISKS

1. Large field (22 runners) increases randomness - many talented horses at big odds
2. Lady Olenna drawn barrier 12 - needs clear run in traffic
3. Autumn Break (#12 FAV) may prove the class is there despite the rise

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

The favorite **Autumn Break** ($2.35) is a glaring underlay. While unbeaten in 3 starts, those wins came at Albury/Wagga in country maiden/CL1/CL2 races. This is a metro BM72 with 22 runners on a Soft 5 - a massive step up. Fair odds are $4.50+. The market has overreacted to the unbeaten record.
