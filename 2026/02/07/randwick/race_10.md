## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Mal Coupe has won 4 of 10 starts (40% strike rate) with excellent wet track form - 2 wins from 2 heavy, 2 wins from 4 soft. Unbeaten in rain-affected conditions at 1100m.

**Class**: Rising sharply from BM78 win but showed he's progressive with dominant 4.6L maiden win on heavy followed by 3 straight wins. First metro Saturday start is the query.

**Conditions**: Soft 5 with rain forecast plays directly to Mal Coupe's strengths. 6 career starts on soft/heavy - 4 wins, 2 places (100% place rate).

**Bias**: Track bias unknown (LOW confidence) - no adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Mal Coupe is a genuine wet-tracker resuming from a spell with two sharp barrier trials showing he's ready. His 4/4 record on soft/heavy is remarkable, and the rain-affected Soft 5 track is ideal. At $26, the market is underestimating his chances. Place specialist score of 2.08 and 60% career place rate make him an outstanding each-way proposition at long odds.

## MAIN DANGERS

**#5 Nervous Witness ($4.00)**: Well-regarded horse resuming for new connections. Won trial by 7L but 493 days between runs is concerning. Poor wet form (0/3 soft, 0/0 heavy) vs today's Soft 5.

**#3 The Black Cloud ($5.00)**: Excellent soft track record (4/8, 50%). Nash Rawiller booking. Form reads well - won at Eagle Farm on soft. Main threat to Mal Coupe placing.

**#6 Celui ($5.50)**: Two trial wins, won BM88 at Randwick on soft last prep. Barrier 3 suits. Freedman stable in good form.

## KEY RISKS

1. Mal Coupe first metro Saturday start - class rise query
2. Nervous Witness first-up class animal if firing fresh
3. Market knows something - genuine $4 favourite

## MARKET NOTES

- Market percentage: 123.6% (standard metro overround)
- Favourite #5 Nervous Witness $4.00 (25% implied)
- Expert picks split across #5, #3, #6, #9 (1 source each)
