# Randwick R1 | 1600m BM72
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 15r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**VALUE: #11 HIGHBORN HARRY @ $12.00 - 1.5u E/W**

EW Value via Path A (Value Overlay) + Path B (Place Specialist)

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | EW EV | Tier |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|------|
| 4 | Charleroi | 16 | $4.60 | 18% | 47% | -17% | -14% | WATCH |
| 5 | Kingston Charm | 15 | $5.50 | 14% | 34% | -23% | -25% | PASS |
| 6 | Starphistocated | 7 | $7.50 | 12% | 34% | -10% | -11% | WATCH |
| 14 | My Phar Lady | 5 | $7.00 | 11% | 30% | -23% | - | PASS |
| 1 | Cape Byron | 10 | $8.50 | 10% | 28% | -15% | - | PASS |
| **11** | **Highborn Harry** | **9** | **$12.00** | **8%** | **35%** | **-4%** | **+14%** | **VALUE** |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Highborn Harry boasts extraordinary place consistency - 55% career place rate (17 places from 31 starts). Last 6 runs: 3-3-4-2-9-3 showing consistent frame finishes. Won last time on heavy, handles wet.

**Class**: Stepping up from BM64/72 provincial form to metro BM72. Has run 6x at Randwick C/D for 0 wins but solid placings - knows the track.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected with no dominant leader. Midfield runners should get their chance. Highborn Harry typically settles back and runs on.

**Conditions**: Soft 5 with rain forecast suits. Going record: 1-6 from 10 soft starts (70% place rate on soft). Wet track specialist.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Highborn Harry qualifies as EW VALUE through two paths: (A) Value Overlay with +13.6% EW EV and 35% place probability, and (B) Place Specialist with exceptional 3.27 specialist score (vs 1.3 threshold). The 55% career place rate dramatically exceeds his 16.8% expected place rate based on ability. At $12, the place component paying $3.75 offers genuine value. Tommy Berry engagement suggests stable confidence. Wide barrier (9) manageable in 15-runner field on Soft track.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (9) in large field - needs luck from midfield
2. 0 wins from 6 Randwick attempts - better placer than winner here
3. Class rise to metro BM72 - has battled at this level previously

## MARKET WATCH

| Horse | Odds | Comment |
|-------|------|---------|
| #4 Charleroi | $4.60 | Fav, wide draw (16), drops in class, wet tracker |
| #5 Kingston Charm | $5.50 | J McDonald, 12 Randwick runs, wide barrier (15) |
| #6 Starphistocated | $7.50 | Good draw (7), handles wet, up in trip |
| #3 Etched In Time | $15.00 | Back-to-back wins, stepping up |

## PASS NOTES

**#4 Charleroi** ($4.60): Favourite but barrier 16 a significant negative in 15-runner field on soft. Strong wet form (1-1 heavy, 1-4 soft) but price too short given draw. Fair odds $5.56 vs market $4.60 = -17% edge.

**#5 Kingston Charm** ($5.50): James McDonald aboard and 12 Randwick starts experience, but barrier 15 problematic. Consistent placer (36% career) but poor EW value at current price.

**#6 Starphistocated** ($7.50): Best draw of the main chances (7), excellent wet track form (1-1-4 heavy, 1-1 soft). However, stepping up from 1400m last start and only 12 career starts. Watching brief at current price.
