# Randwick R9 | 1600m BM100
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 16r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**STRONG_VALUE: #3 NELLIE LEYLAX @ $31 - 0.8u EW**

Secondary: #5 Juja Kibo @ $17 - 0.6u EW (if fresh-up angle appeals)

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | EW EV | Tier |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|--------|-------|------|
| 3 | Nellie Leylax | 5 | 31.00 | 8% | +148% | 35% | +173% | STRONG_VALUE |
| 5 | Juja Kibo | 4 | 17.00 | 9% | +53% | 32% | +57% | VALUE |
| 14 | Hellsing | 6 | 9.00 | 10% | -10% | 30% | -10% | WATCH |
| 12 | Bear On The Loose | 2 | 6.50 | 12% | -22% | 35% | -19% | WATCH |
| 16 | Sun God | 8 | 4.00 | 15% | -40% | 38% | -35% | PASS |
| 7 | West Of Africa | 13 | 5.00 | 10% | -50% | 27% | -45% | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Wet Track**: Soft 5 with rain continuing - WET TRACKERS ESSENTIAL. #3 Nellie Leylax (Soft 4/5/9, Heavy 2/3/3) and #5 Juja Kibo (Soft 3/3/3 = 100%) are standout mud runners at overlaid prices.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. #6 War Eternal and #8 Thunderlips likely to press forward. No dominant leader - suits midfield runners who can position.

**Class**: BM100 - competitive metropolitan grade. Several horses dropping from city stakes class including #7 West Of Africa (wide draw kills) and #14 Hellsing (no heavy form).

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - assume neutral. Inside barriers minor advantage in rain.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#3 NELLIE LEYLAX** is the standout value play at $31. This 5yo gelding has an outstanding wet track record - 4 wins and 5 places from 9 soft track starts (44% win, 100% place), plus 2 wins and 3 places from 3 heavy starts. The step to 1600m suits with 2 wins from 4 distance starts. Barrier 5 is ideal, and while recent form reads 4-2-1-5 the trial win at Beaumont (8 Jan) suggests readiness. Alysha Collett retains the mount. At 31-1 with 1/4 place odds of $6.25, the each-way value is exceptional (+173% EW EV).

**#5 JUJA KIBO** offers secondary value at $17. Perfect soft track record (3 wins from 3 starts - 100%) but the 125 days absence and drop back from 2400m staying trips to 1600m is a query. If trainer Ciaron Maher has him fit, the class and wet form is elite (3rd Metropolitan, 2nd Colin Stephen). Barrier 4 suits.

## KEY RISKS

1. **#3 Nellie Leylax**: First-up from trial only - fitness unknown vs race-hardened rivals
2. **#5 Juja Kibo**: 125 days off, significant distance drop (2400m to 1600m)
3. **Market favorite #16 Sun God**: Poor heavy form (0/0/2) but still prominent if track improves

## MARKET WATCH

- **Sun God $4.00 FAV** - Overbet. 0 wins, 0 places from 2 heavy starts. Vulnerable if rain continues.
- **West Of Africa $5.00** - J McDonald engagement positive but barrier 13 in rain is death. Pass.
- **Bear On The Loose $6.50** - Place chance only. Barrier 2 good, wet form solid, but class query at BM100.

## CONDITIONS IMPACT

Track currently Soft 5 with rain forecast. If track deteriorates to Heavy:
- **Upgrade**: #3 Nellie Leylax (2/3/3 Heavy), #5 Juja Kibo (1/1/2 Heavy)
- **Downgrade**: #16 Sun God (0/0/2 Heavy), #14 Hellsing (0 Heavy starts)
