## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Satin Summer clocked 57.92s winning 1000m at Randwick - solid 2YO time. Agrarian Girl's Warwick Farm trials in heavy ground look sharp (46.99s for 800m).

**Pace**: FAST/CONTESTED - multiple speed types including Savage Look (provincial winner), Agrarian Girl, and Scintillation all showed early toe in trials. Likely to be genuinely run.

**Class**: Low-grade 2YO event ($19,575 prize). Spicy Miss has the best credential (2nd Golden Gift G2, $190k prizemoney) but resuming after 90 days.

**Bias**: Track bias unknown (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain may advantage horses with wet form - favors Agrarian Girl, Essay, Threads.

## KEY CONTENDERS

**#5 SPICY MISS ($3.00)** - Market elect has best form line (2nd Golden Gift). Ciaron Maher resuming 2YOs perform well but 90 days off is longest in field. No wet track form is the query on a Soft 5 with rain. Price too short for unknowns.

**#2 CAMPIONE D'ITALIA ($4.60)** - Waller/McDonald debutant was a close 2nd in two trials including Rosehill (54.70s). Heavy track trial 2nd suggests wet competence. Barrier 8 OK. Trials suggest genuine but price assumes too much.

**#7 SATIN SUMMER ($5.50)** - Proven at the C/D with 1000m win at Randwick (57.92s). T Berry/M Freedman in form. BUT: wide barrier 12 problematic in 12-runner sprint and no soft/heavy form. Fair price, no edge.

**#10 AGRARIAN GIRL ($27)** - Interesting roughie. Won two trials on wet tracks (Heavy & Soft) at Warwick Farm including last-start win by 0.02L. Waterhouse/Bott with 3 runners suggests trying to win. Good barrier 4. Odds offer value IF wet track ability translates.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

This 2YO sprint is a genuine puzzle with no standout value. The market favorite Spicy Miss has clear class but 90 days off and unknown wet form make $3.00 too skinny. Campione D'italia and Satin Summer are logical dangers but prices reflect their chances fairly.

Agrarian Girl at $27 offers theoretical value based on wet track trial form, but backing a first-starter over proven racetrack performers is speculative. The continuous scoring model rates this as WATCH territory across the board.

**Recommended action**: PASS on this race. No edge identified. Monitor Agrarian Girl if drifts further and track deteriorates.

## KEY RISKS

1. Spicy Miss resumes fresh - Ciaron Maher pattern may overcome layoff
2. Campione D'italia debut - Waller/McDonald combo demands respect
3. Wide barriers (7, 11, 12, 13) face disadvantage in 1000m sprint

## GREEN LIGHTS / RED FLAGS

| Horse | Green Lights | Red Flags |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Spicy Miss | Elite trainer, class edge, good barrier | 90 days off, no wet form, short price |
| Campione D'italia | Waller/McDonald, good trial form | Debutant, barrier 8 |
| Satin Summer | C/D winner, proven | Wide barrier 12, no wet form |
| Agrarian Girl | Wet track trials, good barrier | First starter, weak jockey |
