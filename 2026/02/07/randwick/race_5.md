## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Monte Veebee (7) dominant favorite with 70% place rate career; recent BM68 win by 4.2L impressive but stepping up in class. Oakfield Jupiter (4) has won 4/5 career starts including BM72 at Randwick (1200m) - untested at BM78 but rising star profile.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Bundeena (1) and Highway Strip (9) likely early speed. Monte Veebee sits midfield and finishes strongly - pace suits. Oakfield Jupiter versatile - has led and sat handy.

**Class**: First BM78 test for Oakfield Jupiter but 80% win rate and quality wins suggest can handle the rise. Monte Veebee rising from BM68 - bigger step. Polyglot (3) has 75% place rate at this level but no wins.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - assume neutral. Soft 5 suits Bundeena (3w/6p from 13 soft starts), Oakfield Jupiter (2w from 3 soft starts), and Polyglot (1w/4p from 6 soft starts).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Oakfield Jupiter represents genuine each-way value at $15. The 4yo mare has won 4 of 5 starts including a BM72 at Randwick 1200m - proven at the course and distance. Yes, this is a class rise to BM78, but the 80% win strike rate and improving profile warrant support at double-digit odds. Wide barrier (12) is a concern but the 90-day break suggests freshened for a target - James McDonald clone-type booking of Aaron Bullock is neutral. The +20% win edge and +25% EW EV justify the selection.

Monte Veebee is a deserving favorite but $2.45 offers no value (-19% edge). The market has correctly identified the class, but has overbet him.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (12) - must go back or use energy to cross
2. First-up 90 days - fitness query despite trial form
3. Class rise - untested at BM78 level
