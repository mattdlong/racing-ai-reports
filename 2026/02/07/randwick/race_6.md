# Randwick R6 | 1300m BM78
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 13r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**STRONG_VALUE: #8 MOTHER GOOSE @ $14 - 1.5u E/W**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|--------|------|
| 6 | Cinsault | 15 | $2.70 | 28% | -24% | 68% | WATCH |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Mother Goose ran 73.59s winning at Rosehill (1200m, Soft) last start - strong sectional.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected with no clear leaders; mid-runners advantaged.
**Class**: Mother Goose rising from BM72 win but has ability for this grade (3 wins, 8 places from 11).
**Bias**: Track bias unknown (LOW confidence) - no adjustment applied.

## KEY FACTORS

**#6 Cinsault (Fav $2.70)**: Last start winner at Randwick 1400m on Good. Key concern: 3/3 on Good, 0/7 on Soft tracks. Wide barrier 15 in rain. Tommy Berry stays aboard but conditions against. Market overstates chance.

**#8 Mother Goose ($14)**: Outstanding 73% place rate (8/11). Last 3: 1-2-1. Won at Rosehill last start on Soft 5 (same conditions). Gary Portelli stable in form. Inside barrier 6, Alysha Collett aboard. Massive overlay at current odds.

**#3 Candlewick ($4.60)**: Joseph Pride runner, consistent (75% place rate). Ran 3rd at Randwick last start. Barrier 2 advantageous. Lacks killer punch but should be competitive.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Mother Goose represents exceptional each-way value at $14. The mare has won 3 of 4 starts on Soft/Heavy tracks and comes off a dominant last-start win at Rosehill on Soft 5 (identical conditions). With an 82% edge calculation, 35% place probability, and a specialist score of 2.66, she qualifies via both Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist) for EW value. The inside barrier and suited conditions make the $14 price grossly inflated.

The favorite Cinsault has never won on Soft ground (0/7) despite being 3/3 on Good. The wide barrier 15 and wet conditions are significant negatives against implied 37% market probability.

## KEY RISKS

1. Mother Goose stepping up from BM72 to BM78 for first time
2. Soft track specialist profile may not translate to Randwick course

## EW VALUE QUALIFICATION

| Path | Criteria | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| A | Odds ≥$6, EW_EV ≥+5%, Place≥30% | ✓ ($14, +65%, 35%) |
| B | Odds ≥$8, Specialist ≥1.3 | ✓ ($14, 2.66) |
