## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Guest House dominates at $2.00 but lightly raced field with 6/8 runners having just 0-1 career starts - high uncertainty.

**Pace**: Expect MODERATE tempo. Guest House and Closer To Free likely to press, stalkers in good spot.

**Class**: All 2YOs at metro level, no significant class edge. Prize money ~$107k suggests reasonable quality.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - neutral assumed. Good 4 with rain forecast may deteriorate.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#1 Eurocanto** offers strong EW value at $9.00 (+35% edge). Won impressively at Flemington (1000m) on debut in October, albeit 125 days ago. Ben & Will Hayes stable in form. Barrier 2 ideal for this type. The layoff is a concern but jump outs suggest ready to fire.

**#2 Eternal Warrior** at $7.00 (+26% edge) is the alternative. Won first-up at Caulfield over 1000m on Soft ground - proven at the track. Recent trial (2nd) indicates fitness. Lloyd Kennewell underrated trainer. Wide barrier (8) is the query in small field.

**Guest House** ($2.00) is the obvious horse but overlayed. 35% chance implied price should be closer to $2.85. Single career start at Cranbourne - different proposition at Caulfield. Can't dismiss but no value in the win bet.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

| Horse | Win Odds | Place Prob | EW EV | Rating |
|-------|----------|------------|-------|--------|
| Eurocanto | $9.00 | 46% | +35% | STRONG EW |
| Eternal Warrior | $7.00 | 53% | +26% | STRONG EW |
| Stretan Ruler | $7.00 | 44% | +4% | MARGINAL |

## KEY RISKS

1. **Layoff concerns**: Eurocanto 125 days between runs - fitness query despite jump outs
2. **Favourite dominance**: Guest House has shown genuine talent, may simply be too good
3. **Track deterioration**: Rain forecast - Good 4 could become Soft affecting untested runners
4. **2YO volatility**: Lightly raced juveniles inherently unpredictable

## GREEN LIGHTS

- Eurocanto: Elite stable (Hayes), barrier 2, proven metro winner
- Eternal Warrior: Track winner, recent trial, stalking style suits

## RED FLAGS

- Eurocanto: 125-day layoff, no course form
- Eternal Warrior: Wide barrier (8), one-start profile
