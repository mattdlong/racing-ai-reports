**Scratched:** #9 Grey Ice, #12 Buzzaroon

## ANALYSIS

**Class**: This is a BM100 - a significant class level. Ahha Ahha (#8, $3.30 fav) is making a huge class leap from BM70 level and looks grossly overbet. Narbold (#5) just won a BM78 here at Caulfield 13 days ago and rises appropriately. Verdad (#1) has BM100 experience with a 3rd at this track/distance in a BM100 just 13 days ago.

**Form**: Verdad's consistency stands out - only finished outside the placings twice in last 6 runs. Narbold has 72% place rate (13/18 career) and won here over this C/D last start. Enchanted Jenni (#11) has won 3 of last 4 but faces a big class rise from BM70 grade.

**Pace**: Expect MODERATE tempo. Mr Monaco (#2) has gate 1 and may roll forward. Sneaky Sunrise (#6) and Enchanted Jenni (#11) both drawn well and can settle handy. Verdad from wide barrier (11) will need luck but typically settles midfield.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - no adjustment applied. Rail position unknown.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Verdad (#1)** offers standout each-way value at $15.00. The 5yo gelding brings proven BM100 form (3rd here at Caulfield 1700m BM100 last start), exceptional consistency (76% place rate career), and good ground form (15/21 placed on Good). At $15.00 with place odds around $3.75, the EW EV calculates to +50%. Qualifies via all three EW paths: Path A (odds/EW EV/place prob), Path B (place specialist score 3.96), and Path C (longshot place value). The wide barrier is the main negative but he handles it - ran 2nd from gate 9 two starts back at Geelong.

The market favorite Ahha Ahha is a **strong avoid** - massive class rise from BM70 to BM100, never raced at this distance (1600m), and first time at the trip makes the $3.30 odds a poor proposition (fair odds ~$6.67).

## KEY RISKS

1. **Barrier 11** - Verdad draws wide in a 10-horse field; may need to go back and around
2. **Top weight** - 63kg is 5kg more than bottom weights; significant impost over 1600m
3. **Weather** - Rain forecast could shift track conditions and alter pace dynamics

## MARKET NOTES

- Market % 122.1% (standard overround)
- Favorite: #8 Ahha Ahha @ $3.30 (implied 30%) - OVERBET
- Value: #1 Verdad @ $15.00 (implied 6.7%, assessed 8%) - EW VALUE
