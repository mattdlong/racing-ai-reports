## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Proved (6/8 wins, 75% SR) is the class act resuming after 55 days with solid trials; Don't Hope Do won BM78 at Caulfield 1100m in Oct, proven C/D winner.

**Class**: Proved dropping from Listed level (How Now winner at Caulfield); market underrates class edge. Don't Hope Do comfortable at grade, distance specialist (2 wins from 6 at 1100m).

**Pace**: MODERATE shape likely with Hedged (barrier 1) and Oak Hill (barrier 2) contesting lead. Suits on-pace/stalkers. Proved typically races on speed.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - assume neutral. Inside barriers have slight advantage in small field.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Proved** represents outstanding value at $8.00. This mare has an exceptional 75% win rate (6/8) and drops from Listed class where she won the How Now Stakes at this track. The 55-day freshen is ideal - she's had two jump outs and Craig Williams retains the ride. The market seems to be overreacting to her 13th at Pakenham (soft track over 1400m, wrong conditions). Back to 1100m on Good ground at her winning track with the top jockey makes this a standout EW proposition at 4/1+ odds.

**Don't Hope Do** is a proven BM78 winner at this C/D (won here Oct 15). The 104-day break is a concern but two recent jump outs (1st, 2nd) show fitness. At $8.50 with strong place consistency (64% career), the EW value is solid backup.

## KEY RISKS

1. Proved resuming 55 days - fitness question despite jump outs
2. Rain forecast may deteriorate track; Proved has poor soft track record (0/1)
3. Hedged ($3.40 fav) is consistent placer and draws barrier 1

## MARKET WATCH

- Hedged deserves favoritism on consistency but offers no value at $3.40
- Oak Hill overbet at $3.90 given recent form (2nd beaten 0.75L)
- Pallaton class unknown at this level; first time to VIC

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#1 Hedged** (59kg, Bar 1) - J: H Coffey, T: G Bedggood
Form: 6-2-7-1-1 | Career: 24-6-8-6 (25% win, 58% place)
Good ground specialist (4/18). Last start won Pakenham 1200m. Drops to 1100m, drawn perfectly. Consistent placer but priced to win - no value.

**#5 Oak Hill** (57kg, Bar 2) - J: D Lane, T: Hayes
Form: 1-5-2-x-2 | Career: 18-7-4-4 (39% win, 61% place)
Elite win rate but beaten 0.75L last start at this track (1000m). Stepping up to 1100m query. Damian Lane booking is positive. Overbet at $3.90.

**#7 Proved** (56.5kg, Bar 7) - J: C Williams, T: E Jusufovic
Form: 1-1-x-5-1 | Career: 8-6-0-2 (75% win)
Exceptional strike rate. Won How Now (Listed) at Caulfield Nov 15. Only failure was soft track 1400m. Returns to winning track/distance with top jockey. VALUE.

**#6 Don't Hope Do** (57kg, Bar 5) - J: T Stockdale, T: S Zahra
Form: 1-3-4-1-3 | Career: 14-4-5-4 (29% win, 64% place)
C/D winner (Oct 15 BM78 1100m). Excellent place strike rate. Long break (104 days) but jump outs promising. VALUE at $8.50.

**#8 Pallaton** (54kg, Bar 6) - J: J Melhame, T: M Freedman
Form: 3-5-6-2-1 | Career: 8-2-2-2 (25% win, 50% place)
NSW galloper making VIC debut. Won barrier trial impressively. 3yo with light weight is attractive but unknown at this level. WATCH.
