## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Welcometotheshow has won 4 of last 6 starts with exceptional consistency (93% place rate career). Rising through grades impressively with BM78->BM84->BM88 victories. Regal Zeus won Barton Stakes last start but faces big class jump to BM100 mile.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no confirmed leaders, Rise At Dawn and Regal Zeus likely to sit handy. Welcometotheshow races on-pace and should handle the tempo.

**Class**: Big class test for several - Welcometotheshow stepping from BM88 (+12 rating jump), but form trajectory supports. Rise At Dawn has Crystal Mile 3rd (Group 2) but hasn't won at this level. Regal Zeus has Listed form but untested at BM100.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - no significant style or barrier bias detected. Neutral rail position.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Welcometotheshow is the value play at $9.00. This 4yo has won 6 from 14 with an astonishing 93% place rate - exceptional consistency. Won last 4 starts including BM88 at Randwick (94.28s - strong time). The Luke Currie booking maintains top-level representation. While the BM100 class rise is significant, the horse's trajectory and consistency profile suggest continued competitiveness. The $9.00 represents value against an estimated 12% win chance and 34.5% place probability. EW EV of +5.7% qualifies as each-way value.

Rise At Dawn ($3.40) is overbet - Crystal Mile 3rd is quality form but hasn't fired fresh this prep and the price offers no margin. Regal Zeus ($5.50) has claims with 2-from-2 at Caulfield 1600m but Barton Stakes time (82.59s for 1400m) doesn't translate to a standout mile figure.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise from BM88 - first test at BM100 level
2. Wide barrier (9) in 14-runner field may cost ground
3. Rise At Dawn and Regal Zeus have stronger C/D records

## MARKET WATCH

- Rise At Dawn short at $3.40 (implied 29%) vs assessed 24% - UNDERLAY
- Regal Zeus fair at $5.50 (implied 18%) - FAIR
- Holymanz $13.00 shows value on figures but lacks recent form
