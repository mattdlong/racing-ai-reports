# Caulfield R7 | 1400m BM100
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 8r | Good 4 | Rain

## ACTION

**VALUE: #5 SANDPAPER @ $10 - 1.5u EW**
**EW VALUE: #6 HUGHES @ $13 - 1.5u EW**

Market leaders Tom Kitten ($3.10) and Zou Sensation ($3.10) are both underlays on assessed probability. Value sits with the each-way plays at double-digit odds.

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Sandpaper won the Carrington Stakes (1400m, Good) at Randwick 13 days ago, proving his BM100 credentials. Hughes was a narrow 2nd in the Barton Stakes (1400m) at this track 13 days ago - both horses are race-fit and in form.

**Class**: BM100 is appropriate class for this field. Sandpaper has won twice at BM100 level. Hughes has been competing in Listed/Group company and drops back - his last win was an Open Hcp at Sandown.

**Distance**: Hughes is a proven 1400m performer (6 wins from 19 starts at the trip). Sandpaper has 4 wins from 14 at 1400m. Both excel at this distance.

**Track**: Hughes 1/4 at Caulfield, Sandpaper 1/5. Neither has a dominant C/D record but both have place form here.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#5 SANDPAPER ($10)** - B Baker / J Mott
- Last start winner Carrington Stakes, Randwick (1400m, Good)
- Strong 1400m record: 4/14 (29%)
- Good track form: handles Good/Soft equally well
- Barrier 6 no concern in 8-horse field
- GREEN LIGHTS: Last start winner, proven at class, race-fit

**#6 HUGHES ($13)** - G Bedggood / H Coffey
- 2nd Barton Stakes at this track 13 days ago (beaten 0.2L)
- Outstanding distance record: 6/19 at 1400m (32%)
- Career: 7/22 (32%) with 64% place rate - STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (2.96 score)
- Barrier 3 ideal
- GREEN LIGHTS: Track-fit, distance specialist, low barrier
- AMBER: 0/7 on Soft/Heavy - monitor if track deteriorates

**#4 ZOU SENSATION ($3.10)** - Corstens/Larkin / J Melham
- Co-favourite but SHORT on assessed probability (26%)
- Best form: Won Kensington Stakes (1400m, Flemington) and Weekend Hussler (1400m, Caulfield)
- Strong C/D record: 3/5 at Caulfield 1400m
- 37 days since last run - fitness query after Listed 2nd
- RED FLAG: Price does not reflect true edge - UNDERLAY

**#1 TOM KITTEN ($3.10)** - Freedman / C Williams
- Quality galloper - 3rd Mackinnon Stakes (G1, 2000m) in spring
- 90 days since last run, but has had 2 trials
- Wide barrier 8 a concern in small field
- RED FLAG: Long absence, wide draw, short price - UNDERLAY

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Sandpaper** represents the best value in the race at $10. A last-start winner in similar class at Randwick, he arrives race-fit with strong 1400m credentials (4 wins). The +20% edge is genuine with EW EV of +16.9%. Trainer Bjorn Baker targets Melbourne successfully.

**Hughes** qualifies via two EW paths - Value Overlay (Path A) and Place Specialist (Path B). His career 64% place rate is exceptional (2.96 specialist score). Beaten just 0.2L in the Barton Stakes here 13 days ago. At $13, the EW value is compelling with +20.5% EW EV.

Both market leaders look short. Zou Sensation and Tom Kitten are quality horses but priced at $3.10 when fair odds are $3.85+ and $4.15+ respectively. The edge is with the overlays.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Track deterioration**: Rain forecast - Hughes has 0/7 record on Soft/Heavy. Monitor conditions.
2. **Small field dynamics**: 8-horse field means less margin for error - pace may not suit closers.
3. **Fitness queries**: Tom Kitten (90 days) may improve sharply if ready.
