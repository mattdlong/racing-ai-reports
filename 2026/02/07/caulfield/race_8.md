## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Alpha Sofie (#2) is the class runner with 3 wins from 4 starts including Listed Atlantic Jewel Stakes. Jenni The Ninja (#5) unbeaten in 2 starts with strong Flemington win last start. Signature Scent (#4) has course form with 1 win from 2 Caulfield starts at 1100m.

**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected. Thanks Gorgeous (#6) and Wintery (#7) likely to press forward. Alpha Sofie and Jenni The Ninja can settle midfield and finish over them.

**Class**: Alpha Sofie clearly the class horse - winning Atlantic Jewel (Listed) represents a class edge over BM78 rivals. Esha (#3) struggled at Group level (Moir Stakes 8th) but that experience could prove valuable here at benchmark level.

**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence - neutral assumed. No adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Esha (#3)** qualifies as EW VALUE via Path A (Value Overlay):
- Odds $11 >= $6 threshold
- EW EV +7.5% >= +5% required
- Place probability 30% >= 30% minimum

Damian Lane takes the ride on this filly who has ability but disappointed last start at Flemington (10th). The key is the significant class drop - she contested the Moir Stakes (G1) and Champagne Stakes previously. The barrier (10) is a concern but at 1100m there's time to find position. With rain forecast, her soft track form (1:1-1-0) is a positive.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (10) in 12-horse field - must use energy early
2. 335 days since last race start for Bel Merci (#1), 153 days for Alpha Sofie (#2) - freshness vs fitness queries
3. Alpha Sofie clearly the class horse - if firing, others are racing for minors

## MARKET ANALYSIS

- **Favorite**: Alpha Sofie $3.00 (implied 33%) - SHORT given 153-day absence
- **Market %**: 119.6% (standard overround)
- **Value**: Esha $11 represents best overlay on the board

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#2 ALPHA SOFIE** ($3.00)
- Peter Moody-trained filly, 3 wins from 4 starts (75% strike rate)
- Won Atlantic Jewel Stakes (Listed) last start by 2L
- 153 days since racing - first-up query
- Good draw (4), handles soft going (2:2-2-0)
- Clear class edge but price too short given layoff

**#5 JENNI THE NINJA** ($6.00)
- Unbeaten in 2 starts, won Flemington 3YF HCP last time
- Won maiden at Pakenham by 0.46L on soft
- Only 27 days between runs - fit
- Barrier 9 workable at 1100m

**#3 ESHA** ($11.00) - EW VALUE SELECTION
- Damian Lane aboard (elite jockey upgrade)
- Contested Group 1 Moir Stakes, Listed Champagne Stakes
- Won impressively at Moonee Valley (3.5L) on soft
- Place specialist score: 1.9 (strong)
