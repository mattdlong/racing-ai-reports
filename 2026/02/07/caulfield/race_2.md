# Caulfield R2 | 2000m BM100
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 7r | Good 4

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Market heavily compressed around short-priced favorite with no value available

The $1.90 favorite Suntora shows clear ability but is over-bet relative to true probability. No other runner presents sufficient edge to recommend a position.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Suntora recorded 122.71s winning at this C/D two weeks ago (BM78), improving mare stepping up in class. Magnaspin won same C/D in 125.05s (slower track speed) at BM100 last start.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No confirmed leaders - Suntora and Magnaspin both settled midfield recently. Should suit runners who can position 3-4 wide with cover.

**Class**: Suntora rises sharply from BM78 to BM100 (22-point jump). Won by 4.25L but that was against weaker opposition. Magnaspin and Berkeley Square proven at this level.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - no reliable data. Rail position not specified. Assuming neutral conditions favor no particular style.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

### #3 SUNTORA ($1.90) - 4yo Mare
- **Form**: 9-1-1-2-3-1 | Improving sharply since stepping up in distance
- **C/D**: 1/1 at Caulfield 2000m (won 2 weeks ago by 4.25L)
- **Going**: 3/13 Good track record, handles conditions
- **Concern**: BM78 to BM100 is significant class rise
- **Green lights**: C/D winner, inside barrier, on upward trajectory
- **Red flags**: Class rise, short price offers no value

### #2 MAGNASPIN ($3.90) - 6yo Gelding
- **Form**: x-6-6-6-6-1 | Won same C/D 6 days ago in BM100
- **C/D**: 1/7 at Caulfield, 3/8 at 2000m distance
- **Going**: 3/21 Good track record (modest)
- **Concern**: Quick backup (6 days), wide barrier (8)
- **Green lights**: Proven BM100 performer, recent winner
- **Red flags**: Wide draw, quick turnaround, previous form patchy

### #1 BERKELEY SQUARE ($6.50) - 6yo Gelding
- **Form**: 6-4-3-5-1 | Inconsistent but capable
- **C/D**: 1/13 at Caulfield (poor), 4/14 at 2000m
- **Going**: 3/18 Good track record
- **Concern**: Wide barrier (7), 10th last start at BM100 Flemington
- **Green lights**: Class proven, experienced stayer
- **Red flags**: Poor Caulfield record, wide draw, recent form dip

### #4 MAKE IT SWEET ($7.50) - 5yo Mare
- **Form**: 5-1-x-3-2 | Place specialist (67% place rate)
- **C/D**: 0/2 at Caulfield, 1/5 at 2000m
- **Going**: 3/15 Good track record
- **Concern**: Unproven at BM100 level, stepping up sharply
- **Green lights**: Strong place consistency, favorable barrier (4)
- **Red flags**: Class rise, no Caulfield wins
- **Note**: STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (1.99 score) - but EW value insufficient at current odds

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market percentage: 121.6% (standard)
- Suntora $1.90 (implied 52.6%) vs estimated 35% = **OVERBET**
- Magnaspin $3.90 (implied 25.6%) vs estimated 20% = **OVERBET**
- Berkeley Square $6.50 (implied 15.4%) vs estimated 14% = **FAIR**
- Make It Sweet $7.50 (implied 13.3%) vs estimated 12% = **FAIR**

## KEY RISKS

1. **Suntora's class rise**: BM78 to BM100 is a 22-point jump - 4.25L winning margin may not translate
2. **Magnaspin quick backup**: Only 6 days since winning - condition query on soft track
3. **Market compression**: Heavy favorite support leaves no value anywhere in the market

## RECOMMENDATION

**PASS** - No actionable value identified. Suntora likely wins but odds of $1.90 require ~53% probability to break even - our assessment is 35%. Wait for better opportunities.

If forced to take a position, Make It Sweet E/W offers marginal place value at $7.50/$2.88 given her 67% career place rate and strong place specialist score (1.99), but the negative EW EV (-2.5%) makes this unattractive.
