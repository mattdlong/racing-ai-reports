**EW VALUE: #7 GLOBAL ECLIPSE @ $8.00 - 1.0u EW**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier | Stake |

| 1 | Bluestone | 3 | $6.00 | 22% | +32% | 60% | EW_VALUE | 1.5u |

| 2 | Highland Bling | 5 | $11.00 | 8% | -12% | 26% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Bluestone returns after 167 days with exceptional place record (90% career). Six consecutive placings before spell. Global Eclipse coming off last-start win at BM66 with 82% place rate.

**Class**: Ambassadorial ($1.90) stepping up from BM70 - appears short. Bluestone and Global Eclipse both rising in class but have shown ability at this level.

**Distance**: Bluestone 1:1 at 2000m. Global Eclipse 2 wins from 3 at trip - proven distance form. Hurry Curry 0/6 at 2000m - concerning.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW. Neutral expectation. Rail position unknown.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#1 BLUESTONE** offers exceptional each-way value. Despite 167 days off, this horse has an extraordinary placing record (9 places from 10 starts, 90%). Two jump-out preps suggest ready to run well first-up. Form pre-spell was 2-2-2-2-3 in BM74-78 company - consistently knocking on the door. At $6 with the place specialist profile (score 1.46), he represents strong overlay territory (+32% edge). Good track record and class-proven.

**#7 GLOBAL ECLIPSE** qualifies via both Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist score 1.83). Last-start winner rising sharply in class is the concern, but 82% place rate means he rarely misses a cheque. At $8 each-way, the place component alone shows +32% EV.

**#3 AMBASSADORIAL** is the class runner resuming but $1.90 is too short. Fair odds are $2.50 based on 40% win probability. He should be competitive but offers negative expected value.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Bluestone** - Long break (167 days), freshness unknown despite jumpouts
2. **Global Eclipse** - Big class rise from BM66 to BM78 (12 rating points)
3. **Weather** - Rain forecast; Bluestone handles soft (1/4) but Global Eclipse untested heavy

## PLACE SPECIALIST ANALYSIS

| Horse | Career Place% | Specialist Score | Classification |
|-------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Bluestone | 90% | 1.46 | PLACE SPECIALIST |
| Global Eclipse | 82% | 1.83 | STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST |
| I Only Wish | 57% | 0.95 | Normal |
| Ambassadorial | 50% | 0.72 | Normal |
