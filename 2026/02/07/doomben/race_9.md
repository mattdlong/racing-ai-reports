# Doomben R9 | 1200m BM90
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 7r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**VALUE: #2 HATCHET @ $4.00 - 1.5u EW**

Each-way value play. Strong place probability (75.7%) with +16.2% EW EV. Win bet no edge at current price but excellent place component (+32.5% place EV).

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Hatchet won last start at Sunshine Coast BM90, beating today's rival Hell by 0.2L. Proven at this track (6 wins from 23 starts at Doomben) with excellent distance record (7 wins from 25 at 1200m).

**Soft Track**: Critical factor today. Hatchet has 4 wins from 14 on soft (28.6% SR) vs Hell with 5/12 on soft (41.7%). However, Weigall Tiger is a concerning 0/7 on soft - fade despite good recent trials.

**Class**: BM90 level suits both top two. Hell dropping from BM90 last start, Hatchet proven at this level. Weigall Tiger resuming from 139-day break with poor wet track form is a significant red flag.

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected. Hell likely to lead or stalk, Hatchet to sit handy. No confirmed speed suggests genuine tempo rather than slow crawl.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#2 Hatchet** gets the call over the short-priced favorite Hell based on value assessment. At $4.00 vs $1.75, Hatchet offers identical win EV (0%) but significantly better EW value (+16.2% vs -16.3%). The 0.2L margin last start confirms they're closely matched, but Hell is carrying a 33.5% overbet premium. Hatchet's outstanding track record at Doomben (26% win rate, 65% place rate from 23 starts) provides additional confidence. The inside barrier (4) is superior to Hell's barrier 3 in a small field where early position matters less.

**#3 Hell** is the class runner with 76% career place rate but $1.75 offers no value. Fair odds should be $2.63. The market has priced in the class edge, recent win, and Tony Gollan's 38% win rate. Too short.

## KEY RISKS

1. Hell has superior soft track win rate (41.7% vs 28.6%) - could prove difference
2. Hatchet is 7yo - age-related decline possible despite recent win
3. If track deteriorates to Heavy, Hell's single Heavy start (0/1) and Hatchet's limited sample (1/3) create uncertainty
