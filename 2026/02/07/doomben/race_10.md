## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Rock Hard Love on a 4-race placing streak, won on soft at Gold Coast 6 weeks ago. I'm Heroic just ran 2nd at Eagle Farm on soft, proven wet tracker.

**Going**: CRITICAL FACTOR - Soft 5 with rain. Rock Hard Love: 10 starts on soft for 3 wins, 7 places (100% ITM). I'm Heroic: soft 10:2-5, heavy 4:2-3 - thrives in wet.

**Class**: Both stepping up slightly but form franked. Rock Hard Love won CL4 last start, I'm Heroic competitive in CL5.

**Bias**: Track bias unknown (low confidence). Wide barriers concerning but offset by wet track specialist profiles.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#9 Rock Hard Love** is a standout wet track specialist with a perfect 100% in-the-money record on soft ground (10:3-7). The $8.50 price significantly underrates this horse's chances given the Soft 5 conditions with ongoing rain. Coming off a dominant 1.1L win at Gold Coast on soft (27 Dec), this horse is primed. The wide barrier (14) is the only concern, but with rain affecting the track, the outside running may actually prove beneficial. At +27.5% edge, this represents strong each-way value.

**#8 I'm Heroic** offers even higher edge (+32%) as a lightly-raced 4yo with outstanding wet track credentials. Heavy track form of 4:2-3 and soft form of 10:2-5 shows this horse handles the going. Just ran a competitive 2nd at Eagle Farm on soft 10 days ago, suggesting peak fitness. The inside barrier (3) is an advantage. At $12, this is an underrated chance.

**Favorite Assessment**: #1 Nails Murphy is deserving favorite with strong recent form (won last 2), but the $3.50 price offers no value. True probability around 22% suggests fair odds of $4.50. The soft track is not ideal (9:1-5 on soft vs 14:3-10 on good).

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (14) for Rock Hard Love - must overcome in large field
2. I'm Heroic stepping up in class from CL5 to BM78
3. #1 Nails Murphy could dominate if he handles the wet better than his record suggests
