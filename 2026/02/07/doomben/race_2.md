# Doomben R2 | 1200m BM72
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 6r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO WIN BET** - Short-priced favorite offers no value; field lacks overlay.

**EW SPECULATIVE: #9 ANDI DON'T CARE @ $9.50 - 1.0u EW**
Path B qualifier: Place specialist (4.96 score) at double-digit odds.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Tier | Notes |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|------|-------|
| 3 | Dominant Darcy | 4 | $1.75 | 52% | 88% | -9.0% | VALUE | Fav, short price |
| 4 | The Stars | 3 | $4.20 | 22% | 56% | -7.6% | WATCH | Waller, soft form |
| 1 | Mr Bubbaluski | 6 | $6.50 | 12% | 47% | -22.0% | PASS | Placegetter |
| 9 | Andi Don't Care | 8 | $9.50 | 6% | 34% | -43.0% | EW VALUE | Place spec 4.96 |
| 7 | Divine Diamonds | 10 | $11.00 | 5% | 24% | -45.0% | PASS | Resuming 216d |
| 10 | Heavenly Conquest | 7 | $13.00 | 3% | 22% | -61.0% | PASS | No soft form |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Dominant Darcy (#3) won impressively at this track/distance last start by 2.78L on Soft 5. Tony Gollan-trained, rising through grades with 100% place strike rate (3/3). The Stars (#4) for Waller also consistent (6 places from 11 starts) but untested at Doomben.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No dominant speed; Mr Bubbaluski (#1) likely to roll forward from barrier 6. Dominant Darcy can stalk from barrier 4.

**Class**: BM72 metro. Dominant Darcy rises from Maiden win to CL1 2nd - progressive profile. The Stars rises from CL2 provincial, slight query on metro class.

**Going**: Soft 5 crucial. Dominant Darcy 1 from 1 on Soft. The Stars 1 from 6 on Soft (places well). Andi Don't Care 1 from 2 on Soft with excellent place record. Heavenly Conquest has ZERO soft track form (5 starts all on Good) - significant query.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No Best Bet identified - the clear favorite Dominant Darcy at $1.75 offers insufficient value despite strong credentials (fair odds ~$1.92). The market has priced correctly.

Andi Don't Care (#9) qualifies as **EW Value via Path B** (Place Specialist). Career record of 5 places from 6 starts (83%) is exceptional. Won last start at Ipswich on Soft and placed 2nd start prior. Tony Gollan-trained with the mare profile that hits the board consistently. Wide barrier (8) is the concern but small 6-horse field mitigates this.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Dominant Darcy** - legitimate class rise from Maiden? Only 3 career starts
2. **Andi Don't Care** - barrier 8 in 6-horse field, must go back
3. **Track deterioration** - Rain forecast may push to Heavy

## GREEN LIGHTS / RED FLAGS

**Dominant Darcy**:
- [+] C/D winner (1/2 at Doomben 1200m)
- [+] Soft track form (1/1)
- [+] Tony Gollan stable
- [-] Only 3 career starts (limited form)

**The Stars**:
- [+] Waller stable (first Qld start)
- [+] Good wet track record (1/2 Heavy, 4 places from 6 Soft)
- [-] First start at Doomben
- [-] Wide barrier for class rise

**Andi Don't Care**:
- [+] 83% place strike rate (5/6)
- [+] Won on Soft last start
- [+] Tony Gollan stable
- [-] Barrier 8 of 10
- [-] Stepping up in class
