## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Ten Deep dominant favorite (2 wins from 2 recent starts) but untested at 1350m and stepping up significantly in class. Hello Lovely won impressively last start at Ipswich (soft track), barrier 4 advantageous.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Acappella Sun and Ten Deep likely to race on-pace from inside draws. Hello Lovely can settle midfield and finish over the top.

**Class**: Ten Deep rising from CL5 to BM70 is significant (2 class levels). Acappella Sun and Hello Lovely already proven at this level.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - neutral assumed. Soft 5 with rain favors wet-trackers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Hello Lovely** rates the value play at $16. Won last start at Ipswich on a soft track, draws barrier 4 (inside advantage), and the claim from Tahlia Fenlon offsets the weight. Her going record shows 2 wins and 2 places from 8 soft track starts. At odds, represents +28% edge with strong EW value (+19.8% EW EV).

**Acappella Sun** is the backup at $8.50. Won at this course and distance last start (78.88s on Good), with proven soft track form (2 wins, 8 places from 18 soft starts). Chelsea Baker retains the ride. 45% career place rate makes EW attractive.

## WHY NOT THE FAVORITE

**Ten Deep ($2.60)** is talented but represents poor value:
- First attempt at 1350m (career distances: 1000-1200m only)
- Rising 2 class levels (CL5-SW to BM70)
- Wide margin victories were against weaker fields
- 28% implied probability vs our 28% assessment = no edge
- Fair odds $3.57, market $2.60 = -27% underlay

## KEY RISKS

1. **Hello Lovely**: First metro start since Jul-25, may lack race fitness for Doomben tempo
2. **Acappella Sun**: Recent form patchy (x479 last 5), needs to recapture Jan-17 winning form
3. **Ten Deep**: May handle class rise better than expected if others don't fire

## SOFT TRACK SPECIALISTS

| # | Horse | Soft W-P | Soft Strike |
|---|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Acappella Sun | 2-8/18 | 56% |
| 4 | Ten Deep | 2-5/6 | 83% |
| 12 | Hello Lovely | 0-2/8 | 25% |
| 13 | Glass Of Rose | 2-2/5 | 80% |
