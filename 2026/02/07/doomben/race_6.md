# Doomben R6 | 1350m BM70
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 15r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Market appears efficient. Favorite Too Many Thoughts close to fair value but insufficient edge for recommendation. Wet track and large field increase volatility.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Tier | Note |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|------|------|
| 9 | Too Many Thoughts | 3 | $2.90 | 32% | -7% | VALUE | Fav, 1/1 soft |
| 19 | Land Bank | 15 | $4.60 | 14% | -36% | WATCH | Wide draw |
| 7 | Ramp It Up | 16 | $7.00 | 11% | -23% | WATCH | Wide draw |
| 5 | Boom Shot | 6 | $7.50 | 8% | -40% | WATCH | 83d spell |
| 4 | Astra Star | 14 | $13.00 | 6% | -22% | PASS | Wide draw |
| 1 | Earl Of Bantry | 7 | $19.00 | 5% | -5% | PASS | 0/2 soft |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Too Many Thoughts won BM78 last start (83.59s for 1400m); class drop advantage. Boom Shot has best course figures but long break.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No dominant on-pace runners; should suit midfield runners who can finish.

**Class**: Too Many Thoughts dropping from BM78 win to BM70. Land Bank rising from BM58 (big jump). Boom Shot handles this level.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence; Soft 5 with rain expected to stay wet. No adjustment applied.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#9 Too Many Thoughts** (FAV $2.90)
- Form: 7-x-1-3-1-1 | 50% win, 75% place from 8 starts
- Trainer: Mark Currie | Jockey: Jai Williams
- Going: 1/1 soft (100%), 3/7 good
- Distance: 2/3 at 1300-1400m
- Edge: Dropping in class after BM78 win. Barrier 3 ideal. First Doomben start.
- Risk: Short price, untested at metro Doomben

**#19 Land Bank** ($4.60)
- Form: 1-6-5-3-2-1 | Tony Gollan stable
- Going: 1/5 soft (20%)
- Edge: Won BM58 by 3.33L last start, progressive type
- Risk: Barrier 15, big class rise from BM58 to BM70

**#7 Ramp It Up** ($7.00)
- Form: 9-2-2-x-5-5 | 1/9 soft, 1/1 heavy
- Edge: Handles wet, placed both runs this prep
- Risk: Barrier 16 in 15-runner field, needs luck

**#5 Boom Shot** ($7.50)
- Form: 5-6-1-2-x | 10 Doomben starts (2 wins)
- Going: 1/2 heavy, 0/8 soft
- Edge: Course specialist, won here on heavy
- Risk: 83-day break, soft record poor (0/8)

## KEY RISKS

1. Too Many Thoughts first metro Doomben start - course inexperience
2. Soft track conditions favor proven wet-trackers; #9 limited soft data (1 start)
3. Large field (15r) increases volatility and wider draws disadvantaged

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market is reasonably efficient. Too Many Thoughts is the class runner dropping in grade but $2.90 implies ~34% which is close to estimated 32%. No value overlay identified.

**Recommended Action**: PASS this race. If forced to have an interest, Too Many Thoughts is the logical top pick but short price offers no value edge.
