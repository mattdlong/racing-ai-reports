## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Break Free (50% win rate, 4/8) won impressively last start at Sunshine Coast BM68, handles wet tracks well (2 wins from 4 soft starts). Revolt has won 7 of 11 career starts but all on Good tracks - significant query on Soft 5.

**Class**: This is Listed grade but appears to be a weaker renewal. Most runners stepping up significantly. Break Free rising from BM68 but has shown ability at higher levels (ran 2nd in 3YO Open Set Weight at Eagle Farm).

**Track/Going**: Soft 5 with rain - crucial factor. Taltarni Fields (fav) has excellent wet form (5 wins from 9 soft starts). Break Free proven on soft (2/4). Revolt concerning - 0/2 on soft, all 7 wins on Good.

**Barrier**: Wide barriers a concern in 15-runner field. Break Free (15) will need luck. Revolt (3) well placed. Taltarni Fields (1) ideally drawn.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Break Free (#16)** offers the best value at $10. The 4yo mare is in career-best form with two recent wins, handles soft ground (2/4, plus 1/1 heavy), and trainer Matthew Hoysted has this mare improving. The wide barrier is a concern but with jockey Daniel Moor she should get cover midfield. The +20% edge and +10.4% EW EV make this a STRONG_VALUE play.

**Revolt (#8)** has superior raw ability (64% strike rate) but the wet track query is genuine. Has never won on soft and failed badly last start (8th of 16) at Gold Coast on soft. At $13 the edge is significant (+30%) but confidence is tempered by the conditions.

**Against Taltarni Fields (#1)**: The favourite has exceptional wet track form and the inside draw but at $3.00 there's no value (-16% edge). Price reflects wet track credentials but doesn't leave enough margin.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (#16 Break Free) in 15-runner field on rain-affected track
2. Revolt's wet track query - 0/2 on soft with only start being an 8th
