# Doomben R7 | 1350m BM65
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 11r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**STRONG_VALUE: #2 CERTIFIED COPY @ $8.00 - 1.6u EW**

Secondary: #5 The Torque Xpress @ $6.50 - 0.9u EW

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | EW EV | Tier |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|--------|-------|------|
| 2 | Certified Copy | 2 | $8.00 | 18% | +44% | 48% | +38% | STRONG_VALUE |
| 5 | The Torque Xpress | 1 | $6.50 | 16% | +4% | 46% | +7% | VALUE |
| 1 | Fabulantes | 5 | $2.30 | 40% | -8% | 85% | -4% | WATCH |

| 9 | Ready For Aimee | 9 | $8.00 | 12% | -4% | 35% | -4% | PASS |
| 11 | Silver Smash | 3 | $20.00 | 6% | -20% | 22% | - | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Certified Copy unbeaten in 2 starts on heavy (including 3.5L win at Gold Coast) and has 1 win, 3 places from 4 soft track starts. The Torque Xpress is progressive with 2 wins from 5 starts including an 80% place strike rate.

**Class**: Both Certified Copy and The Torque Xpress are stepping up from provincial/country wins but have shown the ability to handle class rises. Fabulantes is the class runner but short in the market.

**Barrier**: Certified Copy (2) and The Torque Xpress (1) have ideal inside draws on a wet track where the rail is typically preferred. Fabulantes (5) is acceptable.

**Wet Track**: Critical factor today. Certified Copy: 2/6 (33%) wins, 4/6 (67%) places on soft/heavy. The Torque Xpress: 1/2 (50%) on soft. Fabulantes: 2/2 (100%) on soft but untested at this distance.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Certified Copy** represents outstanding each-way value at $8. The son of Written Tycoon has a perfect record on heavy ground and is proven on soft. After a below-par trial at Gold Coast (7th of 7 on good ground), he returns to his preferred wet conditions. The inside barrier (2) is a significant advantage, and Bevan Laming's runners consistently improve second-up. The market has underestimated this horse's wet track credentials.

**The Torque Xpress** offers secondary value at $6.50 from barrier 1. The Matthew Dunn-trained gelding is on an upward trajectory with excellent place consistency. First start at Doomben is a query but the inside draw negates concerns.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Certified Copy**: 34 days since last start (though not unusual for this stable); no form at Doomben track
2. **Fabulantes**: Clearly the most talented runner; 2/2 on soft may see genuine improvement at 1350m

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Fabulantes is $2.30 (implied 43.5%) but our assessment gives ~40% win probability. The favorite is correctly priced but offers no value. The market has underrated Certified Copy's wet track dominance.
