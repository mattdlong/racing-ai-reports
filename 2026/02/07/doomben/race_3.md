# Doomben R3 | 2000m BM78
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 10r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**VALUE: #4 CAPITAL ASSET @ $10.00 - 1.5u E/W**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|--------|------|
| 4 | Capital Asset | 4 | $10.00 | 12% | +20% | 36% | VALUE |
| 9 | Texas Fireball | 11 | $6.50 | 14% | -9% | 40% | WATCH |
| 6 | Lennox | 3 | $6.50 | 15% | -3% | 42% | WATCH |
| 8 | Prince Levi | 2 | $3.20 | 28% | -10% | 73% | WATCH |
| 3 | Raf Attack | 6 | $3.40 | 24% | -18% | 61% | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Wet Track**: Key differentiator - Capital Asset has 27% win rate on soft (3/11), with 82% place rate. Favorites Prince Levi (0/4) and Raf Attack (0/10) have poor soft track records.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Hadouken and Capital Asset likely to settle midfield. No dominant on-pace types should produce genuine staying test.

**Class**: BM78 level, Capital Asset rising after BM78 win on Soft 5 at 1800m five weeks ago. Steps to 2000m for first time but profiles as a stayer.

**Bias**: Track bias unknown - rail position not specified. Assume neutral - no adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Capital Asset represents clear value at $10 in rain-affected conditions. His soft track record (27% win, 82% place) far outstrips the market favorites - Prince Levi has never placed from 4 soft track starts, while second favorite Raf Attack has just 1 place from 10 soft track runs. Capital Asset comes into this off a BM78 win on Soft 5 at 1800m (01/01/26) and the step to 2000m suits his grinding style. Barrier 4 is ideal. At 10-1, the each-way value is compelling with EW EV of +18.1%.

## WET TRACK FORM COMPARISON

| Horse | Soft Starts | Soft Wins | Soft Places | Place% |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Capital Asset | 11 | 3 | 6 | 82% |
| Texas Fireball | 11 | 3 | 6 | 82% |
| Prince Levi | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| Raf Attack | 10 | 0 | 1 | 10% |
| Lennox | 6 | 0 | 1 | 17% |

## KEY RISKS

1. First run at 2000m - untested at trip (mitigated by stayer profile)
2. Wide barrier runners may get cover in small field
3. Rain forecast could see track deteriorate further

## GREEN LIGHTS

- Won BM78 1800m Soft 5 last start (01/01/26)
- Outstanding wet track record (82% place rate soft/heavy)
- Good draw (barrier 4)
- Consistent placer: 53% career place rate

## RED FLAGS

- First time at 2000m
- Provincial class rise to metro
