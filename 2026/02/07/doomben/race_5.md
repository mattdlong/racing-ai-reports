## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Yoyo Yeezy has outstanding form (3 wins from 5 starts, 60% SR) but is too short at $2.30 with implied probability 43% vs assessed 35%. Air We Go comes off a strong 1000m win at Eagle Farm and handles Soft going (2 wins from 4 starts on Soft).

**Class**: BM65 level suits several runners. Air We Go drops back from a BM65 win; Royal Commodore won a BM82 return last start at Grafton, suggesting class edge here.

**Distance**: Air We Go stepping up from 1000m to 1110m - has previous 1110m form (4th at Doomben). Royal Commodore first try at 1110m but has shown ability over similar distances.

**Conditions**: Soft 5 with rain favors horses with proven wet track form. Air We Go: 2 wins/3 places from 4 Soft starts. Yoyo Yeezy: 2 wins from 2 Soft starts but still overbet.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#1 Air We Go** qualifies via EW Value Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist). The horse shows a 67% career place rate (6 places from 9 starts), translating to a Place Specialist Score of 2.79. At $11.00, the EW Expected Value is +8.7%, meeting all Path A criteria: odds >= $6, EW EV >= +5%, and place probability >= 30%. The inside barrier (2) is advantageous in a Soft track sprint, and the horse has shown consistent competitive efforts.

**#6 Royal Commodore** represents similar value at $11.00 with EW EV +9.5%. Coming off a strong 2L win at Grafton in a BM82 return race, this is a class drop that could see improvement. Concern is the wide barrier (12) on a wet track, but the horse has 2 wins from 3 Soft track starts.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Air We Go**: Distance query (1110m is 110m beyond best winning distance); relies on placing rather than winning
2. **Royal Commodore**: Wide barrier (12) on soft track may require extra ground; first Doomben start
3. **Market risk**: Yoyo Yeezy is a talented, lightly-raced horse who could simply be too good for this field despite value concerns

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

- Market percentage: 126.4% (standard overround)
- Favorite: #8 Yoyo Yeezy @ $2.30 (implied 43.5%)
- Market appears to be underrating place chances of consistent runners at double-figure odds

## SCRATCHINGS (5)

#4 Moonhaven, #7 Wallenda, #10 Star Rapper, #11 Bright Blonde, #16 Satin Stiletto
