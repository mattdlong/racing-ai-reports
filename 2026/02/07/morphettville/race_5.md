| 9 | Toorak Blaze | 16.00 | 38 | 7% | +12.0% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Thermodynamic brings the most consistent form at the trip with back-to-back seconds at 1550m (Nov) and solid 5th in higher-rated BM72 Clare Cup over 1800m. Longer Route is the market leader but racing too frequently (6 days back) and unproven at 1800m (0/2).

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no genuine leaders in the field. King Of Wessex (barrier 1) and Longer Route (barrier 3) likely to control from the front. Mid-runners and closers should get their chance.

**Class**: Consistent BM66 field. Key droppers: Longer Route drops from BM74/BM78, suits. Toorak Blaze from country cups is an intriguing roughie but lacks metro experience.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - no adjustment applied. Rail position unknown.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Thermodynamic offers the best value in this field at $7. The 6yo has proven form at 1800m (1 win from 3 starts) and excels when races are run at a moderate tempo. Two recent seconds at 1550m show he's in peak form and the step to 1800m suits his staying profile. Barrier 2 ensures he gets a cozy run in transit and Connor Murtagh retains the ride. The 41% place probability and +3.7% EW EV make each-way the optimal bet structure.

## KEY RISKS

1. Good track record solid (6 wins from 17 on Good) but better on Soft (3/14)
2. Longer Route well weighted and class drop is significant

## MARKET WATCH

Toorak Blaze ($16) shows theoretical value (+12% edge) based on recent 1750m Cup win at Port Lincoln, but lacks metro experience and wide barrier (10) is a concern. Monitor for support but pass at current odds.
