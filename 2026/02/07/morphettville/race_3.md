*#9 Fear The Zou - SCRATCHED*

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Rathlin Express (7) has the most consistent form with 4 placings from 7 starts including 2nd last start at Morphettville over 1200m. The only horse in the field with race experience at this track/distance combo. Maysoonfly (10) showed promise in trials, placing 3rd and 5th in two jumpouts before debut.

**Class**: BM68 is a moderate benchmark. Most runners are maidens stepping into ratings company for the first time. Rathlin Express has been competitive at this level in Victoria. Gazz (6) ran 8th in a 3YO BM68 at Morphettville previously.

**Pace**: Moderate pace expected. City Pro (1) and Kikkuli (2) have shown early speed in trials. Rathlin Express typically settles midfield and finishes strongly.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - neutral assumption applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Maysoonfly (#10)** represents the value play at $4.80. Debuting filly from the Andrew Gluyas yard with Jason Holder aboard. Showed ability in two trials - 5th at Gawler (1000m) then improved to 3rd at Murray Bridge (1000m) behind Rathlin Express. The inside barrier (2) is advantageous in a 9-horse field. Light weight (55kg) and filly allowance. At $4.80, the +5.6% edge and +7.4% EW EV makes her the value selection over the short-priced favorite.

**Rathlin Express (#7)** is the class horse but $2.45 offers no value (-6.9% edge). Consistent placer who should be competitive again but needs to break maiden status - 0 wins from 7 starts is a concern at short odds. Philip Stokes trained but drawing barrier 6 mid-field.

## KEY RISKS

1. Maysoonfly is a debutante - race day temperament unknown
2. Rain forecast could impact track (currently Good 4)
3. Rathlin Express has the form edge and could finally break through

## MARKET NOTES

- Market: 123.4% (standard overround)
- Favorite: #7 Rathlin Express $2.45 (40.8% implied)
- Value identified: #10 Maysoonfly $4.80 (+5.6% edge)
- Expert tips: Split between #10, #7, #6, #8 (1 source)
