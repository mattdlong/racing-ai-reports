## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | EW EV | Tier |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|-------|------|
| 5 | The Stalker | $9.50 | 14% | +33% | 38% | +26% | STRONG_VALUE |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: The Stalker won last start BM70 (69.65s/1200m), backed up from BM76 win at Gawler. Only 6 days between runs but proven fresh performer with 5 wins from 25 starts.

**Class**: Rising from BM70 to BM80 is manageable - has run 3rd in BM82 at this course (63.61s/1100m). Mic Drop faces bigger class jump from 0-70/BM64 to BM80.

**Track/Distance**: The Stalker has 1 win from 5 at course and 1 from 5 at distance. Vexatious Dancer superior C/D credentials (3/12 course, 3/12 distance).

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected. No dominant leader - Mic Drop, Salsa Fellow, Vexatious Dancer all have on-pace tendencies.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**The Stalker** offers significant value at $9.50 against a short-priced favourite making a substantial class rise. Won last start in good time, has BM82 form at this track, and draws well in barrier 4. The market has overreacted to Mic Drop's impressive winning streak while underrating the class challenge she faces.

**Vexatious Dancer** is a course specialist with strong place credentials (43% career). Back-to-back wins in November before three runs without winning, but those were in tougher company. Each-way value at $7.50.

## KEY RISKS

1. The Stalker: 6-day backup - short turnaround after solid win
2. Rain forecast - track may deteriorate; The Stalker has 0 wins from 6 on soft

## MARKET ANALYSIS

Mic Drop (#10) dominates market at $2.50 (implied 40%) but faces:
- First run at BM80 level (previous best BM64/0-70)
- Untested against seasoned BM80 performers
- 57% win rate flatters - mostly at lower class

Fair odds assessment: $3.50-$4.00 range. Current price offers no value.
