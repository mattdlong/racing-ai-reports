## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Saint Boom won at Balaklava (1600m) in 95.64s, followed by strong 2nd at Murray Bdge. Flaming Eyes won consecutive races including 1600m CL2 at Murray Bdge in 98.85s - proven at the trip.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected with no clear speed. Midfield runners should get an even run. Barrier 1 ideal for Saint Boom to settle handy without cover issues.

**Class**: Both selections rising from CL1/CL2 wins to BM64 - appropriate progression. Favorites Chillcuz and Dirty Old Town stepping up significantly from weaker form.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - assuming neutral. Rail position not specified.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Saint Boom (#3)** presents the best value at $10. Won comfortably at Balaklava 1600m (95.64s) from barrier 1 - draws same barrier today. Consistent place record (53% place rate from 15 starts) makes EW appealing. The 1.69 place specialist score indicates strong each-way credentials. Rising from CL1 win but has shown competitiveness at 0-66 level.

**Flaming Eyes (#5)** won consecutive races including 1600m at Murray Bdge when last at this distance. Despite wide barrier (12), the even tempo should allow settling. Distance winner (2 from 5 at 1600m) with improving profile. Place specialist score of 1.85 supports EW approach.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Saint Boom**: No wet track form (only 1 start on soft, 0 wins) - monitor if track deteriorates with forecast rain
2. **Flaming Eyes**: Wide barrier (12) could be costly if pace collapses; soft track record 0/4

## MARKET ANALYSIS

Favorites **Chillcuz ($4.40)** and **Dirty Old Town ($4.50)** both appear short. Chillcuz has never raced beyond 1500m and showed a moderate run last start at 1500m (6th of 11). Dirty Old Town is lightly raced (4 starts) with promise but untested at 1600m and rising significantly in class from maiden win.
