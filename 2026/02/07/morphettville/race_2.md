## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Violet Lovebug | 3.70 | 30% | +11.0% | 85% | STRONG_VALUE |
| 2 | Intellectual | 2.30 | 35% | -19.5% | 85% | WATCH |

| 6 | Sassy For Sure | 3.10 | 15% | -53.5% | 47% | PASS |
| 5 | More Than Hope | 12.00 | 8% | -4.0% | 27% | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Violet Lovebug won last start at Murray Bridge (1100m) by 0.14L, proving distance aptitude with 3 wins from 4 starts at 1000-1100m. Intellectual has been trialing well but 146 days off racing and last race start was September.

**Class**: Field dropping from 3YO BM64/BM70 company. Violet Lovebug competed at identical class last start. Sir Myka tested at Listed level (Flemington) and struggled - back to suitable grade.

**Distance**: Violet Lovebug: 3/4 at 1000-1100m (75%). Intellectual: 1/2 at track/distance (50%). Sir Myka has only 1 start at this trip (maiden win at 1000m).

**Barrier**: Barrier 1 is a significant advantage in small field. Inside runners should get smooth passage with only 5 starters.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Violet Lovebug offers genuine value at $3.70. Recent form is the best in the race - won well last start at similar distance and identical class. The 3yo filly has a 50% win strike rate and 67% place rate from 6 starts. Gets the inside barrier in a small field which should allow her to dictate from the front or sit just off the speed. Travis Doudle also has Sir Myka but Violet Lovebug is the stable elect with the superior jockey booking (Alysha Warren).

Intellectual is the clear favorite but represents an underlay at $2.30. While talented (100% place rate), the 146-day break with only a recent trial is concerning. First-up record untested and the market is pricing in potential rather than proven form.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain forecast - track may deteriorate from Good 4 (Violet Lovebug 2/3 on Good, 1/3 on Soft)
2. Intellectual could have improved significantly over the break and be underestimated

## GREEN LIGHTS (Violet Lovebug)

- Won last start at distance (1100m)
- Best barrier draw (1) in small field
- Distance specialist (75% at 1000-1100m)
- Trainer double-entered - #1 is stable elect

## RED FLAGS

- Intellectual: 146-day break, first-up record unknown
- Sir Myka: 83-day break, inconsistent recent form (x616)
- More Than Hope: 167-day break, resuming off trial only
