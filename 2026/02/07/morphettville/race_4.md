## ANALYSIS

**Form**: #5 World's My Oyster is the class act with 4/5 career wins (80%) but untested beyond 1400m. #1 Bamyan Buddha comes off a 1600m BM72 win at Murray Bridge (27 days ago) and has 3 wins from 11 starts at the distance.

**Class**: Bamyan Buddha (47 starts, 9 wins) has genuine BM72 form. World's My Oyster rising sharply from Class 2 - first test at this level and distance simultaneously.

**Distance**: Bamyan Buddha proven at 1600m (3/11). World's My Oyster has 0 starts at 1600m - must stretch from 1400m peak. Wild Winner (1/8 at distance) and Surprise Coming (1/8) have only moderate distance records.

**Going**: Good 4 suits Bamyan Buddha (7/31 good track) and World's My Oyster (4/4 good track). Willybeafactor needs soft/heavy (11/50 on wet vs 1/35 on good).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#1 Bamyan Buddha** at $16 represents genuine each-way value. The 7yo has a proven 1600m record at Morphettville (C/D: 3/19 course, 3/11 distance) and won his last start over this exact trip at BM72 level. The 27-day freshen-up is ideal. While the market focuses heavily on the impressive World's My Oyster ($1.85), the favorite faces dual unknowns: first time at 1600m AND first time at BM72+ class. At odds of $16/$3.20, Bamyan Buddha's 53% career place rate and distance credentials make this a Path A EW overlay.

**World's My Oyster** is clearly talented but $1.85 offers no value. True probability ~50% means fair odds of $2.00. The step up from 1200-1400m winners to a genuine 1600m test against seasoned milers is a concern. WATCH only - no bet.

## KEY RISKS

1. Bamyan Buddha is 7yo - declining trajectory possible
2. World's My Oyster may be a superstar in the making; the class/distance query could be a non-issue
3. Rain forecast - if track deteriorates, Willybeafactor becomes dangerous

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

The favorite is fair value at best. Market overcondensed on World's My Oyster given the untested nature of the assignment. The genuine 1600m horses are underlayed.
