## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Only Rebel Tuesday (#2) has race experience at this level with two placed runs (2nd at Morphettville 1050m, 3rd Murray Bridge). A Party In Penang (#1) has only jumpout form but showed promise with a win and 2nd.

**Class**: 2YO maiden/restricted event with minimal class differentiation. Rebel Tuesday's 2nd at this track/distance is the benchmark.

**Distance**: Rebel Tuesday only runner proven at 1050m (2nd). Others stepping up from 600-900m jumpouts/trials or debuting.

**Barrier**: Meadows Flyer (#4) best draw (1), Tommy's Lass (#5) well placed (2). Rebel Tuesday wide (6) but small field mitigates.

## CONTENDER ASSESSMENT

**#2 REBEL TUESDAY** - Most exposed runner with placed form. 2nd at this track/distance (1050m) on 25/10/25 is the key form reference. 104 days off but trialled well (3rd Caulfield 800m, 0.1L off winner). Phillip Stokes stable. 100% place rate (2/2 starts). Concern: market expects more than form shows at $2.90.

**#1 A PARTY IN PENANG** - Jump-out form only: won at Morphettville (600m), 2nd most recent. Stuart Gower. Top weight (59kg) but gelding vs fillies. Toeroek booking positive. Unknown quantity - market respects ability at $3.80.

**#5 TOMMY'S LASS** - Debutante from Hayes stable (Ben/Will/JD). Two jumpouts: 3rd (46.91s/800m) and 4th (50.36s/800m). Elite stable but no raceday experience. Favored at $2.80 on stable alone - risky proposition.

**#4 MEADOWS FLYER** - Best barrier (1). One start for 4th at Murray Bridge 900m (4+ months ago). Recent JO win suggests forward. Long odds ($9.50) but lurker potential.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Three debutantes/near-debutantes** - #5 Tommy's Lass, #6 Tully Hart, #1 A Party In Penang (JO form only) make this highly unpredictable
2. **Market confidence in Tommy's Lass** ($2.80 fav) based purely on stable - no race form to validate
3. **Rebel Tuesday's 104-day break** - returning from lengthy spell despite trial

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

- Market %: 122.5% (standard)
- Favorite: #5 Tommy's Lass @ $2.80 (implied 35.7%)
- Best value on paper: #6 Tully Hart (+20% edge) but unraced

The market heavily supports the Hayes debutante despite zero race experience. Rebel Tuesday has the best exposed form but priced too short at $2.90. No clear value in win betting.

## RECOMMENDATION

**PASS** - This is a speculative 2YO race with three debutantes and limited form lines. The top-rated Rebel Tuesday offers -36% edge at $2.90. While there's theoretical value in the longer-priced runners, the form uncertainty is too high for confident assessment.

If forced to have an opinion: **A Party In Penang (#1)** at $3.80 offers better value than the favorite, with shown ability in jumpouts and the services of Jake Toeroek.
