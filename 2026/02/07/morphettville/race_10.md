## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Thunder Shoc (4) won last start at 1200m BM64 Morphettville, fresh from two strong trials; rising in class but proven at track. Sir Leapalot (6) has won 2 of last 3 at 1200m including last start at Murray Bridge.

**Class**: BM78 metro is a step up for most. Thunder Shoc rising from BM64 win but shown consistent improvement. Sir Leapalot stepping from CL2/BM56 grade - biggest class rise in field.

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected with Out Of Square and Howl likely to press. Thunder Shoc races on-pace, suits. Sir Leapalot typically settles midfield, can finish strongly.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence (neutral assumed). Good 4 with rain - track may deteriorate. Thunder Shoc 3/9 on good, Sir Leapalot 2/10 on good but 1/2 on heavy.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Thunder Shoc** is the top selection based on last-start BM64 win at this track/distance (70.31s), strong trial form (won 2/2/26), and proven Morphettville record (2 wins from 7 starts). The wide barrier (14) is concerning in a 13-horse field but jockey Todd Pannell is capable of navigating. Rising in class from BM64 to BM78 is the key query but the horse has shown progressive improvement. At $4.80 with 22% assessed probability, there's marginal value (+5.6% edge).

**Sir Leapalot** offers the best each-way value in the race. Two wins from last three starts (both at 1200m) shows current form, and the 59% career place rate is exceptional. The class rise from BM56/CL2 to BM78 is significant but the $12 price offers +20% edge on assessed 10% win probability. Strong EW EV of +10.6% with place odds of $3.40.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Thunder Shoc barrier 14** - widest draw, must overcome in big field
2. **Class rise** - both selections stepping up significantly in grade
3. **Weather** - rain forecast may affect track; Sir Leapalot has better wet record
