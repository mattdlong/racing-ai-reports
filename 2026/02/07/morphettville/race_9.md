## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No reliable sectionals available. Form-based assessment shows Daisydoo and Shadowfax with best recent times at 1050m distance.

**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected. Multiple on-pace types (Daisydoo, Bristler) should ensure honest tempo without excessive pressure.

**Class**: BM76 metro - competitive field. Daisydoo rising from 0-70, Shadowfax rising from BM56, Hooked On Wealth rising from 0-70.

**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence - neutral assumed. Rain forecast may assist wet-trackers; Nostryia (3 wins soft/heavy), Hooked On Wealth (3 wins soft) could improve.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Shadowfax** (#11) presents value at $10 based on excellent recent form pattern: 2nd (0.85L), 2nd (0.02L), 1st (2.26L) in last 3 starts. The gelding has found form at Oakbank in lower grades and now steps to metro BM76 - a class rise but with clear improvement trajectory.

Key positives:
- Barrier 3 ideal for 1050m
- Light weight 54.5kg (2kg claim)
- Good track record (20 starts, 3W-7P on Good)
- Trainer Chris Bieg knows this horse

The $10 odds imply 10% win probability; form analysis suggests 12% is fair, creating +20% edge. Place probability ~30% at $2.80 offers EW value.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise from BM56 to BM76 - significant jump
2. Yet to win at Morphettville (1 win from 6 starts at course)
3. Rain may further deteriorate track; only 0-1 from 5 soft starts

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

**Daisydoo** (#3) at $2.60 is the clear UNDERLAY. While the mare has outstanding 79% place rate (11 from 14 starts), she has not won beyond 0-70 class. The $2.60 implies 38.5% win probability - form suggests 25% maximum. Expert tip support (1 source) doesn't justify the price.

**Red Flags on Favorite**:
- Only 3 wins from 14 starts (21% strike rate)
- 0 course wins from 3 Morphettville starts
- Last start 3rd, beaten 0.01L - couldn't win in BM70

## SCRATCHINGS

- #12 Path To Profit (Scratched)
- #13 Bellentia (Scratched)

## LONGSHOT WATCH

**Nostryia** (#2) @ $13.00 - 160 days between runs is a concern, but 3 wins from 9 soft track starts. If rain continues and track deteriorates, each-way at $13/$3.40 could offer value. Monitor conditions.
