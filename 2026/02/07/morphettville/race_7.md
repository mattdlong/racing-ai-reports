## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Guru Warrior (6) has won 4 of last 5 including BM72, BM76, BM78 classes - progressive but now up to BM96. Kirkliston Blu (4) won Strathalbyn Cup (2050m) last start, proven at 2000m+ with 2 wins from 4 starts.

**Class**: Major jump for Guru Warrior from BM78 to BM96 (+18 rating points). Kirkliston Blu has placed in SKYBEAU (open) class and won 2500m BM78 - better credentialed at this level.

**Distance**: Guru Warrior has 3/3 at 2000m+ but quality of opposition was moderate. Kirkliston Blu is 2/4 at 2000m+, both wins decisive. Crimson Vine won 2000m BM78 last start.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW. Neutral assumption - no adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Kirkliston Blu (#4) represents the value play at $12.00. Won the Strathalbyn Cup (2050m) 6 days ago, beating Komachi and Isuspectjeu who re-oppose. While the favorite Guru Warrior has outstanding recent form (4 wins from 5), he's stepping up sharply from BM78 to BM96 - a +18 point class rise. This is his first test at a genuine metro rating. Kirkliston Blu has run in better quality fields (SKYBEAU, BM80) and proven at this distance (2/4). Wide barrier (11) is the main concern but the 2000m trip allows time to settle.

**EW Value**: Place odds $3.20 with 35% place probability = +31% place EV. Strong specialist score (2.29).

## KEY RISKS

1. **Wide barrier**: Barrier 11 requires early work or settling back - fitness test after 6 days back-up
2. **Guru Warrior class test**: If he handles the rise, he's clearly superior on raw ability

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

- **Guru Warrior ($2.70)**: Implied 37%, assessed 28% = -24% underlay. Class rise too big.
- **Komachi ($4.80)**: Implied 21%, assessed 16% = -23% underlay. 2nd last start but beaten by selection.
- **Kirkliston Blu ($12.00)**: Implied 8%, assessed 10% = +20% overlay. EW VALUE confirmed.
