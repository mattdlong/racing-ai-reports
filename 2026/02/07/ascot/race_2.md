# Ascot R2 | 1000m 2YO
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 10r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Boy Crush dominant but $1.80 offers no value (fair odds $1.92)

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Boy Crush | 7 | 1.80 | 52% | -6.4% | WATCH | - |
| 3 | Run Rupert Run | 9 | 8.50 | 12% | +2.0% | WATCH | - |
| 4 | Wickiup | 6 | 8.50 | 8% | -32% | PASS | - |
| 6 | Star Martini | 2 | 9.00 | 6% | -46% | PASS | - |
| 7 | Stern Empire | 8 | 9.50 | 5% | -53% | PASS | - |
| 10 | Sippa Spritz | 1 | 13.00 | 6% | -22% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Boy Crush has superior race form - only runner with actual race wins (1 from 2). Trial form from others is inadequate comparison.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Boy Crush has race tactical speed and should control. Several debutants from trial winners may press early but lack race craft.

**Class**: All 2YOs, but Boy Crush stepped up from 2YO SWP level already. Others are trial graduates making debut.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - Soft 5 with rain. Boy Crush untested on soft (all runs on Good).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Boy Crush is clearly the best horse - 2 starts for 1 win, 1 second at this track. However, $1.80 represents a -6.4% edge (fair odds $1.92). The market has accurately priced this horse. No value bet exists.

Run Rupert Run (Tab 3) shows marginal interest at $8.50 with a +2% theoretical edge based on trial win, but debuting at metro level carries significant risk.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft track unknown** - Boy Crush has zero runs on soft ground (all Good)
2. **Market accurate** - $1.80 offers no overlay; short-priced loss scenario
3. **Trial form unreliable** - 8 of 10 runners are debutants with only trial form

## FIELD ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Form | Runs | Style | Notes |

| 1 | Boy Crush | 7 | 1.80 | 12 | 2 | ON-PACE | Only horse with race wins |

| 3 | Run Rupert Run | 9 | 8.50 | - | 0 | - | Debut - trial winner |
| 4 | Wickiup | 6 | 8.50 | - | 0 | - | Debut - trial winner Albany |
| 5 | London Rose | 5 | 21.00 | 25x | 3 | MIDFIELD | Placed once, outclassed |
| 6 | Star Martini | 2 | 9.00 | 9x | 1 | - | 9th only start, good trials |
| 7 | Stern Empire | 8 | 9.50 | 7x | 1 | - | 7th only start, trial wins |
| 8 | Cos I Am | 10 | 23.00 | - | 0 | - | Debut - trial placings |
| 9 | Ruthless Angel | 4 | 23.00 | - | 0 | - | Debut - trial 2nd |
| 10 | Sippa Spritz | 1 | 13.00 | - | 0 | - | Debut - trial winner |

Limited expert consensus - insufficient for confidence boost.

## VERDICT

This is a **PASS RACE**. Boy Crush will likely win but offers no value at $1.80. The debutants are too risky to oppose him. Wait for better opportunities.
