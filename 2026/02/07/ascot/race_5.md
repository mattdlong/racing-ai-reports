## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Triple The Chant has outstanding wet track record (3 wins from 4 on soft) with back-to-back wins on soft in winter. Returns after form on good tracks.

**Class**: BM58 is appropriate level. Won CL1 and GRAD HCP 60+ on soft - proven at this class on rain-affected ground.

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected with no dominant leader. Suits Triple The Chant's on-pace racing pattern.

**Conditions**: SOFT 5 with RAIN is the key differentiator. Multiple fancied runners have no/poor wet form.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Triple The Chant stands out as the clear value play on a Soft 5 track with rain forecast. The 4yo has an exceptional wet track record: 3 wins and 3 places from just 4 starts on soft ground (75% win rate, 100% place rate). This contrasts sharply with the favorite Southern Firetail who has ZERO soft track starts and is stepping up from a maiden win to BM58 company. The other key market rivals - Lillian (0/3 soft), My Harv (0/2 soft), and War Matters (0/4 soft) - all have concerning wet track profiles. At $4.20 against a vulnerable favorite, Triple The Chant represents strong value with a calculated edge of +26%.

## KEY RISKS

1. Recent form on good tracks (5th, 4th, 6th) less compelling than winter soft track form
2. First run at 1800m - previous best at 1600-1650m

## WET TRACK PROFILES

| # | Horse | Soft Record | Rating |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Triple The Chant | 3/4 (75%) | ELITE |
| 10 | Southern Firetail | 0/0 (untested) | UNKNOWN |
| 4 | Lillian | 0/3 (0%) | POOR |
| 5 | My Harv | 0/2 (0%) | POOR |
| 6 | War Matters | 0/4 (0%) | POOR |
| 3 | Alaskan | 0/7 (0%) | POOR |
| 7 | Bayhara | 0/4 (0%) | POOR |

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

The favorite Southern Firetail ($2.40) is significantly overbet. While talented with William Pike aboard, the 3yo has:
- Zero soft track experience (4 starts all on good)
- Stepping from maiden to BM58 (two-class rise)
- No distance form at 1800m

Fair odds: $4.55 (22% win probability accounting for conditions uncertainty).
