# Ascot R4 | 1200m BM72
Fri 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 11r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Market efficient; soft track creates uncertainty across contenders

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 4 | Lucky I Am | $4.00 | 58 | 18% | -20% | WATCH | - |
| 7 | Rommel's Goddess | $6.50 | 48 | 14% | -9% | WATCH | - |
| 2 | Snippy Which | $8.00 | 52 | 12% | -4% | VALUE | - |
| 8 | Amarlime | $7.00 | 50 | 13% | -9% | WATCH | - |
| 6 | Later Alligator | $9.50 | 42 | 10% | -5% | WATCH | - |
| 1 | Snow Prince | $4.60 | 38 | 11% | -31% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited reliable speed data; #6 Later Alligator posted 69.89s winning at Ascot 1200m on Good - fastest recent figure in field. #4 Lucky I Am ran 69.88s in close 2nd same track/trip.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. #6 Later Alligator and #1 Snow Prince likely to push forward from inside gates. #4 Lucky I Am and #7 Rommel's Goddess to sit midfield. No genuine speed-on, suits on-pacers.

**Class**: BM72 is appropriate for field. #4 Lucky I Am rising sharply after maiden/CL1 wins - class query. #2 Snippy Which and #1 Snow Prince have proven at this level.

**Track**: Soft 5 with rain - critical factor. Going analysis:
- #4 Lucky I Am: 2W-2P from 5 soft starts (40% win) - handles it
- #2 Snippy Which: 1W-2P from 5 soft (20% win) - competent
- #3 Leniency: 2W-3P from 5 soft (40% win) - genuine wet-tracker
- #7 Rommel's Goddess: 0W-0P from 3 soft - AVOID
- #6 Later Alligator: 0W-0P from 2 soft - query

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#4 LUCKY I AM ($4.00)** - Favourite with 76% career place rate (13 places from 17 starts). Ran 2nd at Ascot 1200m last start. Handles soft. Barrier 10 concern in small field. Rising sharply in class from maiden grade. **Vulnerable favourite.**

**#2 SNIPPY WHICH ($8.00)** - Experienced galloper (26 starts). Won fresh at Geraldton then consistent 4ths at Ascot. Clint Johnston-Porter stays on. 50% career place rate. Competent on soft (1W 2P from 5). Best value at the odds. **Each-way interest.**

**#7 ROMMEL'S GODDESS ($6.50)** - In form (1-1-2 last 3 starts) but all on GOOD tracks. 0/3 on soft with no placings - major concern given conditions. Would need track to dry. **Risk on soft.**

**#8 AMARLIME ($7.00)** - William Pike booking significant. High place rate (62%) but only 2 soft starts. Has been runner-up 5 times from 13 starts - classic place horse. Barrier 4 suits. **Place claims only.**

**#3 LENIENCY ($19.00)** - Best soft track record in field (2W-3P from 5). Coming off 7th at Bunbury but that was on Good. If genuinely Soft 5, this is the value play at big odds. Barrier 7 OK. **Longshot value if track stays wet.**

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No bet recommended. The market favourite #4 Lucky I Am is rising sharply in class and has barrier 10 - there's no value at $4.00 with 18% assessed probability (fair odds $5.55). The second favourite #7 Rommel's Goddess has no form on soft ground which is a major negative.

#2 Snippy Which offers the closest to value at $8.00 with consistent placings and competent soft form, but -4% edge is insufficient for a WIN bet. The each-way EV calculation shows -1.3% which is borderline but not compelling.

Monitor market for #3 Leniency if odds drift beyond $20 - has the best soft track credentials in the field.

## KEY RISKS

1. Soft track favours limited subset of runners - #7 Rommel's Goddess exposed
2. Favourite #4 Lucky I Am untested at BM72 level, wide draw
3. Rain continuing - track could deteriorate to Heavy

## WATCH LIST

| Horse | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| #2 Snippy Which | >$9.00 | EW 0.5u |
| #3 Leniency | >$25.00 | EW 0.5u |
| #4 Lucky I Am | >$5.50 | WIN 1u |
