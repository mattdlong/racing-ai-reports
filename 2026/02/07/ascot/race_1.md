# Ascot R1 | 1100m CL3
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 6r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Favorite is short but fair; no value identified in win markets

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|--------|------|
| 4 | Just Walter John | 2 | $2.10 | 38% | -20% | 85% | WATCH |
| 2 | Sound Of Speed | 5 | $3.40 | 22% | -25% | 62% | WATCH |
| 5 | Beyond Measure | 3 | $3.80 | 18% | -32% | 53% | PASS |
| 6 | Deepest Desire | 7 | $11.00 | 10% | +10% | 44% | WATCH |
| 3 | Double The Fun | 6 | $18.00 | 6% | +8% | 27% | PASS |
| 7 | Nice Sort | 1 | $21.00 | 6% | +26% | 20% | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Just Walter John (4) the clear standout - 5 starts for 1 win, 5 placings (100% place rate). Fresh maiden winner rising in class but proven at track. Sound Of Speed (2) consistent placegetter with course experience (4 starts, 1 win at Ascot).

**Class**: CL3 contest - several recent maiden winners stepping up. Just Walter John won maiden impressively by 2.58L at Pinjarra. Double The Fun (3) lightly-raced (2 starts) but 57 days between runs is a query.

**Pace**: Small field of 6 with no dominant early speed. Expect MODERATE tempo. Inside draws (1, 2, 3) advantaged if bias develops in wet. Just Walter John (barrier 2) well placed.

**Conditions**: Soft 5 with rain - track deteriorating. Just Walter John has only 1 soft start (placed), Sound Of Speed has winning soft form (1 win from 2 soft starts). Beyond Measure and Nice Sort are unknowns on wet.

## KEY CONTENDERS

**#4 JUST WALTER JOHN** ($2.10)
- Perfect 5/5 placings career, recent maiden winner
- Barrier 2 ideal in small field on wet track
- Patrick Carbery aboard, Mitchell Pateman stable
- RED FLAG: Class rise, limited soft track data (0-0-1 from 1)
- GREEN LIGHT: 100% place rate, course experience (3 starts)
- Fair odds ~$2.63, current $2.10 is SHORT

**#2 SOUND OF SPEED** ($3.40)
- Proven at Ascot (4: 1-0-0), won on soft
- Coming off 4th last start but in better class
- Holly Nottle jockey - claims 2.5kg
- RED FLAG: Step up in trip to 1100m (0 wins at distance)
- GREEN LIGHT: Soft track form 2: 1-1-0

**#5 BEYOND MEASURE** ($3.80)
- Debut runner, trial form only
- Won trial by narrow margin (0.06L)
- Unknown on wet, unknown at distance
- RED FLAG: Debut, no race experience, wet track unknown
- Pass - too many unknowns

## PLACE MARKET ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Place Odds | Place% | Place EV |
|---|-------|------------|--------|----------|
| 4 | Just Walter John | $1.30 | 85% | +10.5% |
| 2 | Sound Of Speed | $1.67 | 62% | +3.5% |
| 6 | Deepest Desire | $4.00 | 44% | +76% |

**#6 DEEPEST DESIRE** ($11.00 / $4.00 place)
- Only 1 career start (3rd at Bunbury)
- Pearce stable, Brad Parnham jockey (leading rider)
- Wide barrier 7 in small field manageable
- EW VALUE: 10% win prob × $11 + 44% place prob × $3.50 = +25% EW EV
- WATCH for market support

## SELECTION RATIONALE

This is a competitive CL3 with several recent maiden winners stepping up. **Just Walter John** is the class act with an impeccable 100% place rate but is SHORT at $2.10 against fair odds of $2.63. The -20% edge makes this a clear PASS on win betting.

**Sound Of Speed** has the soft track credentials and course form but stepping up to 1100m for first time - the market has this about right.

**Deepest Desire** offers marginal EW value at $11/$4.00 with trainer Pearce and jockey Parnham a good combination, but limited form data (1 start) makes this speculative.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Track deterioration** - Rain continuing, track may reach Heavy, altering form lines
2. **Class queries** - Multiple runners rising from maiden level, unproven at CL3
3. **Debut runners** - Beyond Measure (5) untested, could upset on ability

## VERDICT

**PASS** - No actionable value. Favorite is fair but short. Longer odds runners lack form reliability. Monitor Deepest Desire for late support as potential place value.
