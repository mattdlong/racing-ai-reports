## ANALYSIS

**Key Angle**: SOFT 5 track is the critical differentiator. Several short-priced runners have poor wet form.

**Speed**: Asphalt produced 68.95s winning at Ascot 1200m - fastest figure in field at the distance. Sky Duke's 68.95s win came on Good track only.

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected. Wind And The Lion (bar 2), Almighty Class (bar 1) likely to press forward. Cold Shizzle, Asphalt settle back.

**Class**: BM72 grade. Asphalt rising through grades rapidly (6 wins from 10 starts, 60% strike rate). London's Image proven at higher levels in Victoria but untested on wet.

**Wet Form**: CRITICAL FACTOR
- **Asphalt**: 4/6 on Soft/Heavy (67% SR) - OUTSTANDING
- **Triple Jay**: 4/7 on Soft (57% SR) - Strong
- **Wubin Gold**: 3/4 on Soft/Heavy (75% SR) - Improver
- **Almighty Class**: 0/1 Soft, 0/1 Heavy - QUERY
- **London's Image**: 0/1 Soft - MAJOR QUERY at $3.40

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#7 ASPHALT** is the clear wet track standout in this field. 60% career win strike rate (6/10) with 90% place rate is exceptional. Won 4 from 6 on Soft/Heavy including dominant 7L win at Bunbury on Heavy. Last start 3rd in Carbine Club (Listed quality) at Ascot 1400m - dropping back in class here. Wide barrier (11) is the only concern, but expect to settle back and produce closing burst as track deteriorates. At $6.00, represents +8% edge with strong EW value (6.9% EW EV). Place specialist score of 2.38 indicates strong each-way credentials.

Market has **Almighty Class** ($3.20) and **London's Image** ($3.40) as clear favourites, but both have significant wet track queries. Almighty Class has 0/2 on rain-affected going. London's Image is 0/1 on Soft and has no Heavy form. At their prices, these represent underlays.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (11) on Soft 5 - may be disadvantaged if inside bias develops
2. First run since Nov 22 (76 days) - freshness query
3. Stepping back to 1200m from 1400-1600m range where won last 4

## GREEN LIGHTS

1. Elite wet track form: 4/6 on Soft/Heavy (67%)
2. 90% career place rate - exceptional consistency
3. Class drop from Listed level to BM72
4. In-form trainer Joshua Krispyn
5. Place specialist score 2.38 (Strong Specialist)

## MARKET WATCH

| Horse | Current | Fair Odds | Rating |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Asphalt | $6.00 | $5.56 | VALUE |
| Almighty Class | $3.20 | $4.00 | UNDERLAY |
| London's Image | $3.40 | $4.55 | UNDERLAY |
| Wind And The Lion | $6.00 | $6.67 | FAIR |
