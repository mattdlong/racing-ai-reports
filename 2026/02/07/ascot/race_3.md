## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 7 | Rolling Ruler | 4.40 | 47.2 | 22% | -3.2% | VALUE | 0.5u EW |
| 2 | Celestial Storm | 2.50 | 43.0 | 28% | -30% | WATCH | - |

| 5 | Galaxy Affair | 34.00 | 18.0 | 3% | -8% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Santanova posted 57.96s at this C/D (Good) - quickest recent figure. Rolling Ruler's 58.78s on Soft represents solid benchmark for conditions.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Celestial Storm and Santanova likely to press forward. Rolling Ruler sits midfield from barrier 1, saves ground.

**Class**: BM72 level, even field. Santanova won at this level 3 weeks ago. Rolling Ruler rising from CL3/Grad HCP company - testing but handles step up.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence. Soft 5 conditions favor runners proven on rain-affected ground.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Rolling Ruler presents the best value proposition despite being third-elect. The 4yo has outstanding consistency - 83% place rate from 6 career starts (2 wins, 3 places). Critically, both wins came on Soft tracks (58.78s at Ascot 1000m Soft, 67.36s at Bunbury 1100m Soft). Barrier 1 allows jockey Turner to dictate position in the small field. At $4.40, the market hasn't fully accounted for the wet track suitability over favourite Celestial Storm (0 wins from 5 Soft starts, 0/0 Heavy).

The EW calculation shows +13.2% combined EV despite marginal win value (-3.2%), driven by strong +29.5% place EV at $2.05 place odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise - stepping from CL3/Grad HCP to BM72, limited metro experience
2. Celestial Storm has elite jockey William Pike - market may tighten

## MARKET ANALYSIS

- **Favourite**: #2 Celestial Storm @ $2.50 (40% implied)
- **Market %**: 123.6% (standard overround)
- **Value Gap**: Celestial Storm has concerning Soft track form (0/5)
