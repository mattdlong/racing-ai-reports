## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Great Fortune won last start over this C/D; Battle Commander 2 wins from 3 at 1600m this prep.
**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected - no dominant leader; midfield runners favored.
**Class**: BM66 grade; Great Fortune up from Grad 60+ (slight rise); Battle Commander consistent at level.
**Track**: SOFT 5 - Decision Maker 2/8 on soft (all career wins on soft); Battle Commander 0/9 on soft (CONCERN); Great Fortune 0/6 on soft (CONCERN).

## KEY CONTENDERS

### #4 GREAT FORTUNE ($12) - EW VALUE
- **Form**: 1-2-x recent; won 1600m Ascot last start (96.32s)
- **C/D**: 3/13 at 1600m, 2/16 at Ascot - proven at track/trip
- **Place Rate**: 65% career (22/34) - STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (2.23 score)
- **Concern**: 0/6 on soft tracks - significant query
- **Edge**: +80% on raw time figures; qualifies Path A + B for EW

### #1 BATTLE COMMANDER ($6.50) - VALUE
- **Form**: 1-4-1-3-1 last 5 at 1600m - outstanding distance form
- **C/D**: 5/9 at 1600m (56%!), 4/20 at Ascot - exceptional distance record
- **Place Rate**: 61% career - PLACE SPECIALIST (1.41 score)
- **Concern**: 0/9 on soft (0-2 places) - major wet track query
- **Edge**: +17%; continuous score 58.9 (VALUE tier)

### #7 DECISION MAKER ($19) - SOFT TRACK SPECIALIST
- **Form**: Moderate recent but WET TRACK HERO - 2/8 on soft vs 0/9 on good
- **All career wins on soft**: Perfect wet track specialist profile
- **Place Rate**: 53% on soft (7 places from 8 starts)
- **Edge**: +52% at odds; qualifies Path B (specialist score 1.50)

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Great Fortune shapes as the standout each-way value despite soft track query. The $12 odds represent +80% overlay on raw figures, with strong place specialist profile (65% career). Battle Commander has the best 1600m record in the field (5/9) but concerning 0/9 on soft creates hesitation for win bet. Decision Maker is the logical upset candidate - ALL career wins have come on soft ground, making this his preferred surface while others struggle.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft track**: Top picks Battle Commander (0/9) and Great Fortune (0/6) both unproven on wet
2. **Pike on Soldanelle**: Elite jockey booking at $4.80 suggests stable confidence
3. **Cashel Palace**: Market fav at $4.40, barrier 2 advantage, but 0/1 at 1600m and recent 2nd only run at trip

## TRACK BIAS

No significant bias detected (LOW confidence) - rail position unknown.
