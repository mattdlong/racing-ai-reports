# Ascot R7 | 1400m BM72
Sat 07 Feb | 12:15pm | 10r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - No value identified. Favorite Fancy Red is a deserved market leader but too short at $1.90 (-8.8% edge). No overlay opportunities in the market.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 3 | Fancy Red | 1.90 | 58.8 | 48% | -8.8% | VALUE | - |

| 6 | Platinum Shot | 15.00 | 32.0 | 5% | -25.0% | PASS | - |
| 9 | Thehorseman | 23.00 | 40.6 | 5% | +15.0% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Fancy Red (#3) has the best recent figures - consecutive wins at 1400m showing progressive improvement. Dug Another Hole (#5) has consistent placings at Ascot 1400m.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Fancy Red and Dug Another Hole likely to sit handy; Thehorseman will need luck from off the pace.

**Class**: Fancy Red rising from RTG 66+ after dominant wins - class rise is the main query but form suggests she handles it. Others are exposed at this level.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - no adjustment applied. Soft 5 track with rain favors wet-trackers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Fancy Red** is the clear class horse - 42% career win rate, 83% place rate, ridden by William Pike. Back-to-back wins in soft/heavy conditions, handles wet tracks. However, at $1.90 she's priced to perfection with no margin for error. The -8.8% edge means we're paying overs for probability.

**Dug Another Hole** (#5) has exceptional place consistency (74%) and good Ascot 1400m record, but the $4.60 price doesn't offer value given the 15% win chance assessment.

**Thehorseman** (#9) shows the only positive edge (+15% at $23) but has significant concerns: first-up off 41 days, soft track record 0/2, and has been racing at provincial level (Geraldton). The edge exists but confidence is low.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Fancy Red (if betting)**: Class rise from RTG 66+ to BM72, only 2 starts at Ascot (0 wins)
2. **Wet track query**: Soft 5 with rain - several horses untested or poor on wet (Dug Another Hole 0/1, Asif 0/1)
3. **Wide barriers**: Dug Another Hole (9) and Outspoken Lad (10) drawn awkwardly

## WET TRACK FORM

Key wet performers:
- **Fancy Red**: 1/4 Soft, 1/1 Heavy - handles conditions ✓
- **Hell I Am**: 1/7 Soft, 2/6 Heavy - solid wet tracker ✓
- **Zephyra**: 2/6 Soft, 0/0 Heavy - proven soft ✓
- **Thehorseman**: 0/2 Soft - query ⚠️
- **Dug Another Hole**: 0/1 Soft - untested ⚠️
