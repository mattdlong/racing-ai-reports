## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout - all runners cluster in 57-60s range at 1000m. Eclair Vitality and Effusiv posted best recent Murray Bridge times (52.59s/900m).
**Pace**: CONTESTED - multiple speed types (Babayka bar 1, I Am Piki bar 3, Reoffer bar 5) should press forward. Suits on-pace runners with tactical barriers.
**Class**: Babayka dropping from 0-70/BM76 class - genuine class edge. Path To Profit rising from maiden/CL1 to BM66 - biggest class rise in field.
**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence, no significant pattern detected. Rail position not specified.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#6 Babayka** qualifies via Path B (Place Specialist, score 2.75). Veteran with 54 starts, 52% place rate, and crucially draws barrier 1 in a 15-runner 1000m sprint where position is everything. Dropping from 0-70 class. Course specialist with 12 starts at Morphettville. At $9, the EW odds of $3.00 place offer value given the place consistency.

**#9 I Am Piki** qualifies via Path B (Place Specialist, score 4.11 - strongest in field). Career 69% place rate from 13 starts is exceptional. Draws barrier 3 - ideal in this large field sprint. Ran 10th at Morphettville in 0-70 class (same race as Babayka) but beaten only 0.01L - the entire field was compressed. Jolly stable in good form.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain forecast on Good 4 - track could deteriorate; both selections have mixed wet form
2. Wide-open race with 15 runners at 1000m - high variance, any runner can win from a good position
3. Neither selection has strong winning strike rates (Babayka 11%, I Am Piki 15%) - better place than win prospects
