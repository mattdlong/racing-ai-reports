## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Bassett Babe produced dominant trial/maiden figures (won by 6.29L and 7.68L) but at weak country maiden level. Brenlyn's Legacy has consistent winning times at 900-1175m with margins suggesting above-average ability.

**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected. #6 Bassett Babe likely to lead or sit handy from barrier 5. Limited genuine pace pressure in a 7-horse field suits the favourite, but also suits Brenlyn's Legacy who has shown tactical versatility.

**Class**: #6 steps from a Gawler maiden (won by 6.29L) straight into BM66 - a significant class jump. #1 Brenlyn's Legacy has won at BM66 level at Wagga and is proven at this grade. #2 Bootlegger won a 3YO BM70 at Morphettville Parks 1250m - proven at this C/D and class.

**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). No significant track bias data available for this meeting.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Brenlyn's Legacy is a 4-from-5 winner with an extraordinary strike rate that the market has massively overlooked at $15. While the filly Bassett Babe ($1.40) has impressive raw ability shown through dominant trial and maiden wins, she faces a genuine class test stepping from a Gawler maiden straight into a BM66 at Morphettville - a significant rise. Brenlyn's Legacy has already won at BM66 level, places every start (100% place rate, specialist score 2.98), and the step up to 1250m is the only query after wins at 900-1175m. The EW value is exceptional at +88% EV via Path A, with a 44% place probability.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Brenlyn's Legacy**: Untested at 1250m (longest win at 1175m) and stepping from country to metro
2. **Bassett Babe**: Genuine star quality - may simply be too good regardless of class rise; 6.29L and 7.68L margins suggest a different league of ability

## EW BREAKDOWN

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win EV | +80.0% |
| Place EV | +96.2% |
| EW EV | +88.1% |
| Place Prob | 43.6% |
| Place Specialist | 2.98 (STRONG) |
| EW Path | A (Value Overlay) |
