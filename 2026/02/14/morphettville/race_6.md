## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Nextonixs (90) has the best figures from BM72/Sandown runs; Mintulee (88) next best from BM74 Soft win. In Love's figures (78) are modest but the market drastically underrates this mare.
**Pace**: MODERATE - no dominant leader. Been Our Angel and Nextonixs likely settle forward from low barriers. Gold Spirit (bar 9) will need to be ridden positively to find a position.
**Class**: Nextonixs drops from BM72 level, Mintulee drops from BM74 - both class advantages. In Love fits at BM56 level with a recent 2nd at this grade.
**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). True rail position not specified. Neutral assessment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

In Love at $14 represents the only genuine value play in this race. She's a proven place specialist (48% career place rate, specialist score 2.21) who ran 2nd at BM56 level just 9 days ago at Murray Bridge, beaten only 0.29L. The EW EV is +19.1% with the place component alone showing +12.2% edge. While she lacks the raw speed figures of the top pair, the market has over-compressed the favourites - Gold Spirit at $4.20 with only 14% win probability is the most significant underlay (-41.2% edge). No runner qualifies as a BEST_BET or STRONG_VALUE given the competitive nature of this field and the data limitations (no sectional times, limited bias data).

## KEY RISKS

1. Nextonixs has superior ability if the 146-day spell hasn't dulled her edge - two recent trials (won latest) suggest ready
2. In Love draws barrier 8 in a 10-horse field at 1000m, limiting tactical options
