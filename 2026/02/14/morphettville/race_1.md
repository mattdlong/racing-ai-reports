## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Scandalize posted the best recent time at Murray Bridge (71.25s/1200m) winning by 0.38L, competitive with Cork Harbour's 70.98s Naracoorte win but in stronger context (last-start winner vs patchy form). High On Sugar won at Gawler (70.65s/1200m) but that was Dec and subsequently flopped at BM70 level.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - Cork Harbour and High On Sugar likely to press forward from inside gates (barriers 5 and 1), Scandalize can settle midfield from barrier 8. No genuine speedster to take them along, which suits on-pace runners with tactical speed.

**Class**: Scandalize drops from recent BM58 win where he was competitive with 0-70 trial horses (2nd twice). Back to BM58 is his level and he's proven at it with a last-start win. Captain Joolian was competitive in BM66/BM72 company and drops significantly. Cork Harbour won at BM68 level last start but that was a weak Naracoorte field.

**Bias**: Neutral - no significant track bias detected at Morphettville. LOW confidence on bias data. Good 4 surface is genuine, rain forecast could aid Scandalize (1 from 1 on heavy, 1 from 6 on soft).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Scandalize** is the clear value play. This 4yo is on an upward trajectory with two trial placings followed by a last-start BM58 win at Murray Bridge (71.25s, margin 0.38L). He has the highest class ceiling in this field, having previously won a BM56 at 1400m and placed in 0-70 trials. At $6.00 against a field of largely exposed, patchy performers, the market significantly underrates his chance. The wide barrier (8) is the main concern but in a 9-horse field with moderate pace it's manageable. The EW value is exceptional at +21.5%.

**Captain Joolian** offers secondary EW value at $9.00. Proven at Morphettville (7:1-4) and the distance (18:2-6), he has strong place consistency (39% career). Dropping from BM72/BM66 to BM58 is a significant class drop but recent form is mixed (8th last start at BM72 was a class too high).

## KEY RISKS

1. Scandalize draws barrier 8 - needs to avoid going too wide on the turn in a 1250m race
2. Rain forecast could deteriorate track; Scandalize handles wet but some rivals (Cork Harbour 0/17 on soft) may scratch or underperform, reducing field quality
3. Only 25% expert support for Scandalize - market and tipsters favor High On Sugar ($3.80 fav)
