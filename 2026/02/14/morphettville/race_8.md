## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figures in this field; times are comparable across provincial tracks with #11 Brown Nose Day Gal showing the sharpest recent form winning Murray Bridge 1400m in 84.45s.
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected - several on-pacers (#4 bar 2, #3 bar 1, #16 bar 3) will roll forward but no confirmed leader; mid-race speed likely honest without being suicidal.
**Class**: BM64 provincial level; #11 stepping up from 0-58 wins, #3 has BM64 and BM66 placings at this distance, #13 has placed in BM64/BM76 races consistently.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence) - no significant style or barrier bias detected at Morphettville.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#13 Katim's Club (EW $17)**: Elite place specialist with a career 56% place rate (23 from 41 starts) yielding a specialist score of 4.91. Has placed in BM64-BM76 company consistently including 2nd at Gawler BM66 (1500m, Soft) and 3rd at Morphettville BM64 (1400m). Barrier 6 is ideal in a 17-runner field. While win claims are limited (6% probability), the each-way value is strong at +13.5% EW EV via Path B. The place consistency is the edge here.

**#3 Savatoff (EW $13)**: Proven distance performer with 3 wins from 10 starts at 1500-1600m. Barrier 1 is a significant advantage in a large field. Strong place consistency (42% career) with specialist score of 2.76. Has placed at Morphettville (2nd, 2500m BM78-level) and won at this distance. Coming off a trial and a 12-day freshening. Qualifies EW VALUE via Path B at +4% win edge.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain forecast may shift track to Soft - #13 has soft form (1/12 wins, 7/12 places) but #3 handles it (2/8 wins, 4/8 places on soft)
2. Wide-open 17-runner field creates high variance; any of 8+ runners could place
3. #11 Brown Nose Day Gal is the clear form horse and could be underpriced if she handles the class rise
