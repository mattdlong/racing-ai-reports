## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Bardigrub and Carpe Astra share the best time reference (58.45s/1000m Murray Bdge Dec 20), but both were beaten. Sicilian Princess has the strongest overall form line - 2nd at Gawler 1100m beaten 6.3L in a race run in 64.4s suggests a fast sectional finish. Multiple debutants (Ramasis, Word Game, This Is The Day, Total Love) add significant uncertainty.

**Pace**: CONTESTED - several early speed types (Bardigrub, I Am The Tiger, Sicilian Princess) plus debutants with unknown running styles. The 1000m sprint distance at Morphettville typically favours on-pace runners. I Am The Tiger won a 1000m trial leading all the way (60.11s). Bardigrub tends to settle closer to the speed.

**Class**: This is effectively a maiden/low-grade BM70 - most runners are winless or lightly raced. Sicilian Princess (7 starts, 3 placings) and Rathlin Express (8 starts, 5 placings) have the most experience. I Am The Tiger's sole win came in a trial at Murray Bridge but showed ability.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - neutral detected. Rail position not specified. Good 4 track with rain forecast could deteriorate. No significant bias adjustment applied.

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

- **Bardigrub**: Score 1.98 (STRONG) - 75% place rate vs 37.8% expected
- **Rathlin Express**: Score 2.13 (STRONG) - 62.5% place rate vs 29.4% expected
- **Carpe Astra**: Score 2.65 (STRONG) - 66.7% place rate vs 25.2% expected

## SELECTION RATIONALE

I Am The Tiger at $17 is the value play. Won a 1000m trial at Murray Bridge (60.11s, beating Brand Her Bold and Word Game), draws barrier 7 (mid-field, ideal for 1000m), and has Taylor Johnstone aboard. The 6th at Clare yesterday (1100m, beaten 1.52L in 66.3s) is forgivable - backing up next day over a shorter trip at home track where she has a 1-from-2 course record (won at Morphettville Parks). At $17 the market is offering +36% edge with strong EW value (+30.5% EW EV). The favourite Bardigrub at $4.40 has claims but the wide barrier (13) in a 1000m sprint is a genuine concern, and the -20.8% edge makes it an underlay.

**Secondary interest**: Word Game at $12 shows marginal value (+8% edge, +6.5% EW EV) - was 2nd in the same trial I Am The Tiger won, beaten 0.21L. Todd Pannell is a significant jockey booking for a debutant. Monitor in the market.

## KEY RISKS

1. I Am The Tiger ran yesterday at Clare (back-up) - fitness/recovery question mark
2. Four debutants (Ramasis, This Is The Day, Total Love, Word Game) create unpredictable race dynamics - any one of them could have untapped ability, particularly Ramasis ($5, 3 trial wins) trained by Travis Doudle
