## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Mozu Marcassin has the highest class figures from VIC metro (BM80/84 placed), but Back Me Up Benny's Morphettville 2000m win (124.8s) is the best local speed reference at this distance range.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - Back Me Up Benny and Smother likely to race on-pace from inside draws; Mozu Marcassin and Coorong Tycoon from wide barriers need to settle back. Favours on-pace runners.
**Class**: Mozu Marcassin dropping from VIC BM66/BM80 level to SA BM66 - class advantage. Back Me Up Benny rising from 0-64 win but has placed at BM66 level before.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). No significant barrier or style bias detected. Inside draws marginally preferred at 2250m due to first turn position.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Back Me Up Benny represents clear each-way value at $9.50 with a +23.5% edge and STRONG EW VALUE rating (Path A: odds >= $6, EW EV +21.1%, place prob 31.7%). Won last start at Morphettville over 2000m on Good track by 0.68L, now stepping up to 2250m with a proven distance record (1 win from 3 starts at 2000m+). Barrier 2 is a significant advantage in a 12-horse field at 2250m, allowing him to settle in a forward position without using energy. Place specialist score of 1.61 (STRONG) with career place rate of 44% confirms each-way suitability. The market has overreacted to the class rise from 0-64 to BM66.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise from 0-64 to BM66 - has only placed (never won) at BM66 level previously
2. Inconsistent form pattern (6-7-7-3-4-1) - the win was preceded by three poor runs

## EACH-WAY ANALYSIS

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win EV | +23.5% |
| Place EV | +18.8% |
| EW EV | +21.1% |
| Place Prob | 31.7% |
| Place Specialist | 1.61 (STRONG) |
| EW Path | A (Value Overlay) |
| EW Rating | STRONG EW VALUE |
