## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No clear standout on times; Blue Spinel and Lunar Eight have the sharpest recent closing figures relative to class.
**Pace**: MODERATE - Dream Lantern and Savagery Vibe likely to press, giving closers a chance. Blue Spinel and Stanislaus can sit midfield and finish.
**Class**: Savagery Vibe making biggest class jump (CL2 -> BM70 metro), untested. Blue Spinel dropping from BM78, proven at level. Lunar Eight rising but on a winning streak.
**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain - genuine wet track. Inside barriers slightly advantaged in heavy going.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Blue Spinel** is the standout EW play. Best wet-track record in the field (3 wins, 8 places from 13 soft starts), dropping from BM78 where she placed at Eagle Farm, and Tony Gollan knows the track (3/15 EF). The $10 price offers +20% edge with 32% place probability. Wide barrier (11) is the concern but she can settle midfield.

**Lunar Eight** is the rising star - back-to-back wins (Gold Coast 850m, GC 1000m) before a strong 2nd at 1200m last start. Light weight (56.5kg) and Toby Edmonds in form. Place specialist score of 2.28 supports the EW angle at $8.

**Stanislaus** is the each-way roughie via Place Specialist path (career 52% place rate, specialist score 3.54). The $18 offers +26% win edge and +5% place EV. Barrier 4 ideal in soft ground.

## KEY RISKS

1. Blue Spinel wide barrier (11) in soft ground - may get posted 3-wide without cover
2. Savagery Vibe ($2.70 fav) is the clear class horse if she handles the BM70 jump and wet track - only 1 start on soft for 1 win
3. Rain may worsen track to Heavy - would further advantage Cheval Chic (3/4 heavy) and reduce field to genuine wet trackers
