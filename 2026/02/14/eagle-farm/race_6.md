## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Tacitly posted the standout figure winning by 3.26L at this track/distance on Soft; Giapponese won Eagle Farm 1600m by 1.68L on Good but untested on soft at this level.
**Pace**: MODERATE - North Pole (bar 1) and Koolatah Queen (bar 4) likely to press forward; Tacitly and Giapponese can stalk from midfield. Shape suits on-pace runners with moderate tempo.
**Class**: All runners rising from maidens/low-class wins into BM58 metro. Tacitly's maiden win at Eagle Farm 1840m Soft is the most relevant class reference. Giapponese beat weaker fields at Ballina.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain - track may deteriorate further. No strong positional bias detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#1 Giapponese (EW $6.00)**: Three wins from last four starts showing strong progression. Place specialist score 1.45 with 62.5% career place rate. EW EV of +9.6% via Path A (odds >= $6, EW EV >= 5%, place prob 49.5% >= 30%). Major concern is 0/2 on soft tracks with both runs as a younger horse - must improve on wet ground. The price compensates for the wet track query.

**#8 Valouri (EW $14.00)**: Strong place specialist (4.17 score) with 80% career place rate (4 places from 5 starts). Won on Soft at Gold Coast and placed at Ballina on Good. EW EV of +13.8% via Path B (specialist score 4.17 >= 1.3). At $14 the each-way value is compelling even if she can't win outright. Stepping up to 1820m is a query but her closing style suits the extra distance.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft/Heavy track**: Rain continuing, track may deteriorate to Heavy. Giapponese (0/2 soft) and several others untested on heavy ground. Tacitly (won on Soft here) and North Pole (1/4 soft) better credentialed wet trackers.
2. **Class rise**: Entire field stepping up from maiden/low-class provincial wins to metro BM58. True ability gaps may be smaller than market suggests.
3. **Distance query**: Several runners (Valouri, Koolatah Queen, Kurithea) stepping up to 1820m for the first time. Tacitly is the only proven performer at this distance on this track.
