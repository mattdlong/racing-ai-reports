## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Green Fly has the best class form (BM100/Listed level) but has been plain. Free Carry's Eagle Farm 1400m Soft win (83.66s, by 2.52L) is the standout recent Soft track performance at this distance.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected. John Rambo and Free Carry likely to sit on pace from good barriers. No dominant leader, suits on-pace runners.
**Class**: This is Listed grade. John Rambo and Last Command are rising through the classes; Green Fly has the best class pedigree but trending down. Free Carry stepping up from BM78 but has shown quality.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain - track may deteriorate further, favouring proven wet-trackers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Free Carry is the each-way selection at $8. Won impressively at Eagle Farm 1400m on Soft (BM78, by 2.52L) and is a proven soft track performer (4/11 wins, 36%). Career place rate of 90% (18/20) makes him a strong place specialist (score 1.92). Good barrier (5), Gollan-trained with course knowledge, and 1400m distance suits (2/4 wins). The 90 days off is the main concern but trialled well and Gollan horses often fire fresh. EW EV of +7.0% with place EV +10.0% makes this a clear value play at the odds.

No Best Bet in this race - the favourite John Rambo ($3) has poor value despite strong wet form, as he's untested at 1400m (0/2) and the price doesn't compensate. Last Command ($4) rising sharply from CL4 to Listed with a wide barrier.

## KEY RISKS

1. Free Carry 90 days between runs - fitness query despite trial
2. Class rise from BM78 to Listed is significant (needs career-best)
3. Deteriorating track may become Heavy - changes the race dynamic
