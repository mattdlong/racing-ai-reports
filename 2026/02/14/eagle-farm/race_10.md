## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Press Link posted the fastest recent time (70.05s/1200m EF) winning BM78 last start. Facundo dominant at lower levels but untested at BM85. Gospel Girl only 0.09L behind Press Link last start on 2.5kg worse terms - she gets that back here.

**Pace**: CONTESTED shape with multiple on-pace runners (#6 Jonny Da Wolf bar 2, #3 Slippin' Jimmy bar 3, #15 Gospel Girl bar 5). Enough speed to ensure a genuine tempo which suits on-pace runners with tactical barriers. Closers may struggle.

**Class**: Press Link (BM78 -> BM85) and Facundo (BM70 -> BM85) both rising sharply. Jonny Da Wolf already won BM85 at Gold Coast and ran 2nd in CL6-SW at Eagle Farm. Gospel Girl 2nd in BM78 but won at EF on soft.

**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Soft 6 with rain favours wet-trackers. Inside barriers advantaged in wet conditions historically at Eagle Farm.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Jonny Da Wolf (#6) at $10 represents the best value proposition. He is the only runner with a BM85 win on his resume (Gold Coast 1300m), has an outstanding 70% career place rate (place specialist score 2.76x), and draws perfectly in barrier 2 for a soft track. His soft track record (2 wins, 6 places from 10 starts) is excellent. While 0/5 at Eagle Farm is a concern, his 2nd to race-fit runners in CL6-SW last prep at EF shows he handles the track. At $10 with 1/4 place terms, the EW expected value is +12.3%.

Press Link ($3.20) is clearly the most talented horse but at $3.20 with a class rise and only 9 career starts, the price reflects all the upside. No value at the quote.

## KEY RISKS

1. Jonny Da Wolf is 0/5 at Eagle Farm - course form a genuine concern
2. Press Link may simply be too talented - winning margin of 0.09L understates dominance as he was never fully extended
