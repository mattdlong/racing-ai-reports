## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Nails Murphy has the best recent figures with consecutive wins at Sunshine Coast (95.57s/1600m Good) and Eagle Farm BM85 (2nd, 95.29s). Just Flying won a BM85 at Eagle Farm over 1835m (112.19s) showing staying ability.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - no dominant leaders in the field. Demon Darb draws barrier 2 and can settle forward, which suits on a deteriorating Soft 6. Living Free and Naval Seal likely to be on-pace.

**Class**: Nails Murphy rising from CL3/BM80 wins through BM85, progressive profile. Demon Darb drops back to BM85 after running in the Members Mile (Open) and Tails Stakes. Noble Conqueror rises from BM80 win but drawn barrier 14.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - no reliable pattern. Soft 6 with rain favours runners with proven wet-track form. Demon Darb (5w 6p from 15 soft/heavy starts, 38% win rate soft) and Katdeel (3w 9p from 16 soft/heavy starts) are standouts on the going.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No Best Bet qualifies - the favourite Nails Murphy has the best form profile but is too short at $3.20 (fair odds ~$3.57). The each-way play is **Demon Darb** at $8.50 - a strong place specialist (1.71 score, 45% career place rate) with outstanding soft-track credentials (38% win rate on soft). Inside barrier 2 is a significant advantage in a Soft 6 field of 11 where wide runners face extra work on a rain-affected surface. His recent form (6-4-5-x) is below peak but he won the CL6 at Eagle Farm in May on soft by 4.47L - this horse can produce on his day when conditions suit.

## KEY RISKS

1. Nails Murphy is the class horse and may simply be too good despite the wide draw - 67% place rate is elite
2. Demon Darb's last 5 starts are all unplaced (5-4-6-6-x) suggesting he may be past his best at age 6
