## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Pembrey posted the best raw trial figures with a dominant 3.86L win at Doomben (840m, 49.57s) and 4.5L at Deagon; Swift Dragon's 3 wins from 3 include a 9.29L trial romp but at shorter distances and weaker tracks.
**Pace**: FAST tempo likely with Pembrey, Swift Dragon, and Zandari all showing on-speed tendencies from trial positions - genuine tempo should set up for on-pacers who can sustain.
**Class**: Oregon Coast has the strongest class reference (6th in Widden Stakes at Rosehill against metro 2yo fillies); the rest are untested or provincial-only. Big step up for all runners at Eagle Farm metro.
**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain - no significant style or barrier bias detected (LOW confidence). Inside barriers marginally favored in wet conditions historically.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Zandari wins the value equation at $23. She won the Eagle Farm 850m trial on Feb 3 (52.76s) beating It'sall About Mary (0.13L 2nd) and Madame Doubtfire (0.13L 3rd) - all three are in this field. At $23, the market has dramatically separated Zandari from the top two (Pembrey $2, Swift Dragon $2.70) despite having course trial form at this track. The EW EV is +48.3% with place probability of 24.4%. While Pembrey is clearly the most talented runner here (dominant margins suggest above-average ability), $2.00 offers no value for a 2yo debutante on a Soft 5 at 1000m - too many unknowns remain. The each-way play on Zandari captures value from the market's over-reaction to the top two.

## KEY RISKS

1. No jockey listed yet for Zandari - engagement quality unknown (could signal connections lack confidence)
2. Trial-only form is unreliable; 850m trial to 1000m race on Soft 5 is a significant step up
3. Pembrey may simply be too good - dominant margins suggest genuine class edge over this field

## EW ANALYSIS

| Horse | Win% | Place% | Win EV | Place EV | EW EV | Rating |
|-------|------|--------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Zandari | 6% | 24.4% | +38.0% | +58.6% | +48.3% | STRONG EW VALUE |
| It'sall About Mary | 5% | 22.0% | +5.0% | +32.0% | +18.5% | STRONG EW VALUE |

## MARKET NOTES

- Market percentage: 122.6% (standard overround for 9-runner field)
- Two-horse market: Pembrey ($2.00) and Swift Dragon ($2.70) account for 87% implied probability
- Value sits with the outsiders - the market is pricing the top two as certainties in a 2yo debut race
- Data quality: MEDIUM - limited form (mostly trial-only), no sectional data available
