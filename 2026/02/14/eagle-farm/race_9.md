## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Tiger Tie posted the fastest raw time (56.26s) winning this race two weeks ago; Vodka Martini ran 2nd that day 1.75L off, Power Of The Brave has strong Randwick 56.85s figure.
**Pace**: FAST scenario likely - Tiger Tie, Steady Ready, and Vodka Martini all show early speed at 1000m. Suits on-pace runners from inside barriers. Tiger Tie (bar 1) and Vodka Martini (bar 4) well placed.
**Class**: All runners at or near BM90 level. Manolo Bling rising from BM74 win at Pakenham - class test. Power Of The Brave stepping up from BM78 wins. Tiger Tie won this identical race (BM90 EF 1000m) last start.
**Bias**: Neutral bias confidence LOW. Soft 6 with rain - inside barriers typically advantaged on wet Eagle Farm tracks.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Vodka Martini presents the only genuine value in this race at $6.50. Proven wet-tracker (4/10 on soft, 40% strike rate vs 38% overall) with strong place specialist credentials (score 1.52). Won the Open Quality at Eagle Farm 1000m on soft (58.07s) and ran a solid 2nd in this identical race two weeks ago. The EW proposition is compelling: +11.1% combined EW EV with 47% place probability. Tiger Tie is the likely winner but $2.90 is too short given the Soft 6 query (limited soft form, zero heavy starts).

## KEY RISKS

1. Tiger Tie is clearly the best horse on raw ability - if the Soft 6 doesn't inconvenience him, he wins comfortably
2. Vodka Martini's last-start 2nd was on Good ground; needs to replicate that form on a deteriorating surface
