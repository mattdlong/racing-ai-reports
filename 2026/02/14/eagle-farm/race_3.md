## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Rezone posted the fastest BM70 time at Eagle Farm (95.3s/1600m), but untested at 1820m. Diamond Epic's 110.97s/1800m at Sunshine Coast is the best staying figure.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - no genuine speed in the field. Rezone and Diamond Epic likely settle midfield, Eclair Awesome can position forward without pressure.
**Class**: All runners at or near BM70 level. Caracoron drops from BM80/82 but form there was poor. Sir Beveridge rising sharply from CL4 country grade.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain is the dominant factor - dramatically reshuffles the form.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Eclair Awesome is the standout value play on the Soft 5 surface. Her wet track record (4 wins from 7 starts on soft, 57% strike rate) far exceeds any other runner in the field. She was a close 2nd at Eagle Farm over 1600m on a soft track last preparation, and steps to her preferred 1800m+ range where she won at Newcastle (1870m, soft). The $5.50 price offers +10% win edge and +20.9% each-way EV with 62% place probability and a place specialist score of 1.34. The favourite Rezone (3 straight wins) is the class runner but has a modest 29% soft track win rate and has never raced beyond 1600m - the 1820m on a deteriorating track is a genuine query at $2.50.

## KEY RISKS

1. Barrier 9 of 9 (widest draw) - must work across early
2. Only 0/3 at Eagle Farm for a win, though 2nd there last prep on soft
3. If track improves to a Good 4, edge disappears (0/2 on good tracks)
