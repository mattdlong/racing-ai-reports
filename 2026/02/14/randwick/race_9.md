## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Manaal clocked the fastest 1200m race time (70.40s Sheraco, soft) in stakes company; Countyourblessings ran 69.76s at BM88 level on soft. Lazzura's 72.20s came on heavy.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Tuileries (bar 1) and Countyourblessings (bar 2) can settle on-pace without burning fuel. Manaal (bar 5) maps to midfield with cover. Lazzura (bar 11) must go back or burn energy crossing.

**Class**: Manaal has the strongest form lines - won Listed Sheraco and Group 3 Gold Pendant, placed in The Invitation (worth 100+ class rating). Weeping Woman has class question marks rising from BM78 to Listed. Gerringong's Invitation 2nd is also quality.

**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Rain forecast could shift conditions; Manaal handles soft/heavy (3 wins from 5 on give).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Manaal** is the value play in this race. Her Listed/Group class edge is clear - Sheraco winner, Gold Pendant winner, Invitation placegetter - yet she drifts to $5.50 behind the BM78 mare Weeping Woman. Four wins at Randwick (40% course strike rate) and three distance wins from seven starts (43%) give proven C/D credentials. Two barrier trials (2nd and 4th) suggest she's forward enough first-up for a mare who won the Sheraco fresh in September. The $5.50 offers +10% edge with +11.9% EW EV. Freedman/Collett combination adds confidence.

**Tuileries** is the each-way overlay. Barrier 1 in an 11-horse field at 1200m is gold - she'll get a soft run on the rail. Won at Warwick Farm 1400m first-up previously and has a Randwick 1050m trial 2nd (27 Jan). Canberra Times expert has her on top. Place specialist score of 2.08 (STRONG) and +40.2% EW EV at $15 makes her the standout value proposition. Peter Snowden's mares excel fresh.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain could shift track to Soft - benefits Manaal (3/5 on give) but unknown for Tuileries on heavy
2. Weeping Woman's three straight wins suggest she could be better than her BM78 rating; market may be right
3. Both selections first-up from 100+ day spells - fitness a question in a fast 1200m
