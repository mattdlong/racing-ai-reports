## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No reliable speed figures available (briefing lacks sectional data). Sovereign Hill's two dominant wins (1.78L BM78, 4.81L CL1) suggest superior raw ability but untested at this level.
**Pace**: CONTESTED - multiple on-pace types (Cool Jakey, Getafix, Yoshinobu) in a 15-runner field should produce honest tempo. Mid-runners and closers may benefit.
**Class**: Key question is the BM78-to-BM88 class rise. Sovereign Hill, Althoff, and several others are stepping up for the first time. Getafix (won BM90 Flemington) and Polymnia (placed BM94) have proven class.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). No data from today's meeting to assess.

## KEY CONTENDER NOTES

**#17 Sovereign Hill ($2.80)** - Clear class horse on upward trajectory. Two dominant wins, Waterhouse/Bott/Clark combo. But barrier 16 in 15-runner field is a genuine concern at 1300m, and the BM78-to-BM88 jump is significant. Fair odds ~$4.00 - too short at $2.80 (-30% edge). Rain forecast may not suit (0/3 heavy).

**#7 Althoff ($7.50)** - Similar profile to Sovereign Hill but at much better odds. Back-to-back BM78 wins (Randwick 1400m, Wyong 1350m). Waller stable. Barrier 8 workable. Marginal value (+5% edge) but apprentice jockey (Grima) is a slight concern at this class level. Place specialist score 1.43.

**#4 Getafix ($8.00)** - Best proven class (won BM90 Flemington). Barrier 2 ideal. But two poor runs since (MM Cup, CBY Sprint) raise fitness concerns returning from 27 days. Marginal value (+4%).

**#12 Polymnia ($8.00)** - James McDonald booking is significant. Strong place specialist (2.54 score, 64% career place rate). Dropping from BM94/Listed level. But only 1 win from 14 starts and resuming from 118-day break. EW Value via Path B (specialist). No win edge at current odds.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No selections meet the minimum staking threshold. Sovereign Hill is the most likely winner but is 30% below fair value at $2.80. The next tier (Althoff, Getafix, Polymnia) show marginal edges of +4-5% which fall below the 0.5u minimum Kelly stake. This is a race dominated by class unknowns - multiple runners stepping up from BM78 in a large field, making probability estimates inherently uncertain.

If forced to watch one, **Althoff** at $7.50+ offers the best risk/reward with form on the track, a rising trajectory, and the Waller polish. Polymnia's place specialist profile (64% career) with McDonald aboard makes it the EW watch at $8.00.

## KEY RISKS

1. Sovereign Hill's barrier 16 at 1300m could force wide passage, but Tim Clark's tactical skill partially mitigates
2. Rain forecast may deteriorate track from Good 4 - would hurt Sunshineinmypocket (0/4 soft) and potentially favour Cool Jakey (4/8 heavy)
