*Sovereign Hill is WATCH not BEST BET due to -25% edge (too short).

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sovereign Hill posted dominant 1.78L and 4.81L wins this prep; clearly the best recent form on raw ability. Duvana's 3.46L Warwick Farm win is notable but lower class.
**Pace**: MODERATE - Duvana (bar 4), Happy Bellie (bar 2), and Miss Kim Kar (bar 3) should lead or sit handy. Sovereign Hill (bar 8) comfortable. Not a true pressure scenario which favours the favourite.
**Class**: Sovereign Hill rising BM78 to BM88 after consecutive wins - justified on ability but significant class jump. Changing Colours has BM78 form from Waller yard. Arabian Rose stepping from QLD provincial to Sydney metro.
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. No strong pattern to exploit.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Changing Colours** qualifies as EW VALUE via Path B (Place Specialist). Her 79% career place rate (11 placings from 14 starts) is exceptional - specialist score of 5.37, the highest in the field by a wide margin. Trained by Chris Waller with Tim Clark aboard, she ran 2nd at Rosehill last prep over 1300m and 2nd over 1400m at Rosehill in good form. The $18 price represents +26% edge on win and +23.4% EW EV. Her consistency makes her a strong each-way proposition in a large field dominated by one short-priced runner.

No Best Bet qualifies. Sovereign Hill is the most likely winner but at $2.50 there is no value (-25% edge). He scores 45.5 (VALUE tier) on continuous scoring but the price makes him a WATCH only.

## KEY RISKS

1. Changing Colours has barrier 11 in a 15-runner field - mid-draw is OK but not ideal
2. Her last two starts were 6th (Rosehill 1500m Soft) and 7th (Randwick 1400m Soft) - form has dipped
3. Rain forecast - Good 4 may deteriorate; she has 0 wins from 5 on soft (2 places) which is a concern
4. Sovereign Hill could dominate and render EW plays irrelevant in a one-act affair
