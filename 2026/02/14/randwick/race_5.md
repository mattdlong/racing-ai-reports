## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Cross Tasman has the strongest overall figures; 2nd beaten 0.12L in BM88 at Rosehill last start. It's A Knockout won BM78 by 4.14L and placed in BM96 at 1600m - competitive figures at this level.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No dominant leaders, likely a stalking race. Suits midfield runners who can settle and produce a finishing kick.
**Class**: Cross Tasman rising sharply (BM78 to BM88) but 50% win rate suggests ability to handle. It's A Knockout also rising but proven at BM88+ level (2nd Coffs Cup BM96). Captain Furai stepping from BM78 up.
**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Good 4 with rain - monitor for deterioration.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

It's A Knockout at $6 offers the best value in the race. She's a proven place specialist (67% place rate, specialist score 2.13) with genuine 1600m form including a 2nd in the BM96 Coffs Harbour Cup. The Tim Clark booking adds confidence. Rising from a BM78 win by 4.14L, she has the class to compete here. Cross Tasman is clearly the best horse but at $2.15 (fair odds $2.63) there's no betting value - he's an underlay. The each-way angle on It's A Knockout qualifies via Path A: odds >= $6, EW EV +4.6%, place prob 45%.

## KEY RISKS

1. Cross Tasman is a dominant favourite - if he runs to his rating, minor placings may be the ceiling
2. It's A Knockout resuming from 27 days; last start 12th at Gold Coast (though that was at 1300m in a big field)
3. Rain forecast may change track condition - It's A Knockout has a 2/6 (33%) soft win rate but no heavy track form
