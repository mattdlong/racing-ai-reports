*PASS on value - best horse but unders price

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Autumn Glow (Epsom 93.14s, Golden Eagle 89.72s) holds the best figures by 3-4pts over Ceolwulf (Cantala 98.94s at 1600m) and Lindermann (Chelmsford 94.46s). Class gap is significant.

**Pace**: MODERATE scenario. No confirmed leaders; The Instructor (bar 3) likely presses forward, Ceolwulf and Lindermann settle midfield. Autumn Glow typically settles back and finishes hard. Shape should be fair with no extreme bias to any style.

**Class**: Autumn Glow (Epsom/Golden Eagle winner, G1 class rating ~115) is racing well below her best level in a BM94. Ceolwulf (Cantala Stakes, King Charles III) and Lindermann (Hill Stakes, Chelmsford) also have Group credentials but are a clear tier below. Aeliana (AJC Oaks, Cox Plate placed) has strong form but untested first-up at 1400m.

**Bias**: Neutral rail, no significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Good 4 surface suits most runners. No adjustments applied.

## KEY ASSESSMENT: AUTUMN GLOW

8 starts for 8 wins (100% strike rate). Won Epsom (1600m, Good) by 1.44L and Golden Eagle (1500m, Soft) by 1.25L at elite level. Two barrier trials this prep (5th, 2nd at Randwick) suggest ready to perform first-up. James McDonald retains the ride. Course record: 4 from 4 at Randwick. Distance record: 1 from 1 at 1400m.

**Why no bet**: At $1.55, the market implies 64.5% probability. Our assessment is ~52% (fair odds $1.92). Even being generous at 58% win probability, fair odds would be $1.72. The $1.55 price offers no margin for error in a race where barrier 9 in a 10-horse field and first-up uncertainty are genuine risks.

**Red flags**: (1) First-up off 104 days - historically her career has been built on racing, not resuming. (2) Barrier 9 of 10 - widest of the serious contenders. (3) Only one prior run at 1400m.

**Green lights**: (1) Unbeaten - eight from eight. (2) James McDonald. (3) Two solid barrier trials. (4) Massive class drop from G1 to BM94.

## EACH-WAY SCAN

| # | Horse | Win Odds | Place% | EW EV | Verdict |
|---|-------|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Ceolwulf | $6.50 | 39.2% | -7.9% | NO VALUE |
| 3 | Lindermann | $9.00 | 31.5% | -3.3% | NO VALUE |
| 9 | Aeliana | $10.00 | 28.0% | -9.5% | NO VALUE |
| 8 | Stefi Magnetica | $16.00 | 20.2% | -4.0% | NO VALUE |

No each-way value identified. The market is efficiently priced across the board.

## KEY RISKS

1. Autumn Glow wins easily and we miss out - but at $1.55 the expected return is negative
2. Ceolwulf at $6.50 is the closest to fair value (edge -9.0%, CI touches +0.1%) but insufficient conviction to bet
