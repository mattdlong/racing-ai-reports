## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Apocalyptic is the clear speed figure leader - Furious Stakes (G3) winner at this track and distance in 69.92s, then stepped up to win Tea Rose (G2, 1400m) and Flight Stakes (G2, 1600m). Class well above this BM72 field.

**Pace**: MODERATE - limited early speed in the field. Apocalyptic likely settles on-pace from barrier 1. Sunrays has shown early speed in QLD races. Nepo Baby and Shenandoah River can press forward. No genuine pace-on scenario which suits the class horse.

**Class**: Apocalyptic is a Group 2 winner dropping to BM72 - massive class edge. Savvy Hallie (Silver Shadow winner) and Karinska (Flight 3rd) have the next best class profiles. Sunrays won at BM72 level in QLD. Artistic Venture placed in Tea Rose (G2). Several are dropping sharply but Apocalyptic's class advantage is enormous.

**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Good 4 track with rain - could deteriorate. Apocalyptic 3/4 on good, untested on anything worse at race distance. Sunrays is 3/3 on soft and 2/3 on good - any deterioration helps.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**No win bet on Apocalyptic** despite clear superiority. At $1.65, she's priced at 60.6% implied probability but our assessment is ~45%. The 118-day absence (last raced Oct 18), dropping from 1600m Group level to 1200m BM72, and two barrier trials (900m, 850m) suggest a fitness question for a tough sprint. She's the most likely winner but not at this price.

**Sunrays** (EW, $16) qualifies via Path B (specialist 5.21) and Path C (place EV +21.4%). This QLD 3yo filly has won 5/8 career starts with 7 placings from 8 runs - an elite place rate of 87.5%. Her 1200m form (2nd in 3YO Hcp at Doomben, 69.91s) is competitive for BM72. First visit to Randwick is the question mark but handles all surfaces (3/3 soft, 2/3 good).

**Artistic Venture** (EW, $15) qualifies via Path B (specialist 2.60). Won a recent Canterbury trial (902m) and placed 2nd in Tea Rose (G2) behind Apocalyptic. The 132-day layoff and barrier 10 are concerns, but she has Randwick experience (5 starts) and a 1200m maiden win at Kembla.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Apocalyptic dominance**: If the favourite is at full fitness, she wins this by lengths and the EW runners may not place
2. **Track deterioration**: Rain forecast could shift to soft/heavy - Sunrays benefits but Artistic Venture (1/1 soft) may also handle it; Apocalyptic untested on wet at sprint distance
3. **Fitness after layoffs**: Both EW selections (132d and 13d respectively) face fitness questions

## GREEN LIGHTS

- Sunrays: Elite place rate (87.5%), handles all surfaces, peak QLD form, genuine 1200m speed
- Artistic Venture: G2 Tea Rose placegetter, fresh trial win, +20% edge at $15
- Both qualify at generous prices against a short-priced favourite

## RED FLAGS

- Apocalyptic: Underlaid at $1.65 (fair $2.22), 118 days off, first start at 1200m since Sep '25
- Savvy Hallie: $4.00 is still too short (fair $5.56), 0/4 on good going
- Karinska: J McDonald booking flatters, poor recent form (5,6,5,3), no good-track wins
