## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figure holder in a wide-open field. Warrior For Peace has the best metro form but ran 4th/5th in recent Highway starts. Spenzalot posted the most visually impressive win (8.88L at Scone 2200m) suggesting strong staying ability.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected with several mid-pack runners. With 19 starters and limited genuine speed, the race should be run at a genuine tempo that suits on-pace/stalking types. Spenzalot, Mr Chips, and Remadosi all have tactical speed to sit handy.

**Class**: This is a massive class rise for nearly every runner. Most have been competing in BM58-66 country/provincial grade. The market leaders (Warrior For Peace, Silent Call, Regal Problem) all face significant class tests. Spenzalot's dominant 2200m win at Scone (BM66) and recent progressive form gives confidence over the staying trip.

**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Good 4 track with no rail position specified suggests a fair surface.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Spenzalot (#7 EW @ $9.50)** is the primary selection. Won his last start at Scone 2200m by 8.88L in dominant fashion, suggesting he has significant ability when the distance is right. His form reads 4-4-2-2-1 showing steady improvement through the preparation. The 1800m should suit as a stepping stone from his comfortable 2200m win. Jay Ford is a capable booking. The $9.50 represents +14% edge in a wide-open 19-runner field where the short-priced runners all have clear form concerns.

**Mr Chips (#6 EW @ $23.00)** is the secondary value play. Three starts for two wins and a second (1-1-2) in current campaign, all in country grade. The form is progressive and barrier 6 is ideal in a big field. Place specialist score of 4.04 flags strong EW credentials. The +38% edge and EW EV of +21% make this a standout value play despite the class rise.

## KEY RISKS

1. Massive class rise for all contenders - BM82 metro is several levels above the country/provincial form most have shown
2. Big field (19 runners) increases randomness and wide barriers (12+ for Spenzalot) create tactical challenges
3. Limited expert support data (only 1 source checked) reduces confidence in market assessment
