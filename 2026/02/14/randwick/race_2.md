## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Mal Coupe has the best raw figures but all recorded on soft/heavy; on Good 4 today those figures are unreliable. Be Quiet's Gosford 1100m win (62.48s) and Zoutastic's Hawkesbury 1000m win (58.06s, 3.5L margin) are the best dry-track performances.

**Pace**: FAST - Mal Coupe (barrier 5), Zoutastic (barrier 1), and Sea Admiral (barrier 6) all want to lead. Contested speed in a 1000m sprint should set up for on-pacers and stalkers with tactical speed. Be Quiet (barrier 7) perfectly positioned to sit 3-4 deep and strike.

**Class**: Most runners have been competing at BM72 level. Mal Coupe and Zaragoza have the highest class credentials (BM78-84). Zoutastic rising from BM64 provincial but showed talent winning by 3.5L at Hawkesbury.

**Bias**: Neutral track bias, low confidence. No data to exploit.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Be Quiet** (#10, $12 EW) is the primary selection. Two wins from three starts at 1000m (including a BM68 win at Kembla by 1.5L on heavy), rising through the grades with a 3-win streak in Oct-Dec. Barrier 7 is ideal in a 15-runner sprint with contested speed. Place specialist score of 1.7 and +20% edge at $12 make this strong each-way value. Good track record (1/6) is limited but she won at BM64 level on good and the progression is clear.

**Zoutastic** (#7, $26 EW) is the speculative value play. Barrier 1 is gold in a large-field sprint, and his good-track record (3/7 wins) is the best in the field by percentage. Won by 3.5L at Hawkesbury (BM64) on good ground. The class rise to BM78 metro is the key query, but at $26 the price more than compensates. EW_EV of +70.8% is exceptional if he can handle the grade.

## FAVOURITE CONCERNS

**Mal Coupe** (#1, $3.70) is 0/4 on good ground - every win has come on soft or heavy. Today's Good 4 is a major red flag. Despite J McDonald and outstanding recent form (1-2-1-1-1), backing at $3.70 in a 15-runner sprint on his worst surface is a negative EV proposition. Also returning from 181 days off with only barrier trials as prep.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Be Quiet**: Stepping up from BM64 to BM78 (two class levels); only 1 win from 6 on good ground
2. **Zoutastic**: Provincial form may not translate to Randwick metro; contested lead in a 15-runner field may compromise his chance
3. **General**: 15-runner 1000m sprint is inherently volatile; any result possible
