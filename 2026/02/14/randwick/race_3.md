## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Miss Chanel posted fastest 1100m time (63.82s Rosehill, Good) but is priced accordingly at $2.80 - no overlay. Outspan's 64.83s came on Soft ground at 57.5kg, adjusting for conditions he's within a length of Miss Chanel's rating.
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected. Outspan, Miss Chanel and Ciaron's Star likely to settle on-pace or midfield. No dominant leader identified, suits on-pace runners with tactical speed.
**Class**: All 2YOs, open race. Miss Chanel has strongest form line (2nd in Widden Stakes, 0.32L off Chilly Girl). Outspan won convincingly at Rosehill by 1.27L. Better By Far was beaten a nose at Scone stepping up from barrier trial win.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Good 4 with rain forecast - could shift to Soft during meeting, potentially advantaging Outspan (2/2 runs on Soft, both placed).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#1 Outspan (VALUE @ $5.50)**: Talented colt who won impressively on debut at Rosehill by 1.27L. Wide barrier 12 is the key negative, but his raw ability deserves a 20% win probability vs the market's ~15%. The +10% edge at $5.50 represents fair value, not a screaming overlay, but with rain forecast and his proven Soft track ability (1 win, 1 place from 2 Soft starts), he could be the improver if the track deteriorates. Trained by Michael Freedman with Sam Clipperton retaining the ride.

**#7 Better By Far (EW VALUE @ $14)**: Strong Place Specialist score (2.35) qualifies her for EW via both Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist). Missed by a nose at Scone on debut after winning her barrier trial by 2.68L at Randwick. The step to 1100m on a firmer surface with a good barrier (5) should suit, and at $14 the each-way represents 39.7% EW EV. Three Waterhouse/Bott runners in the race (Miss Chanel, Caloocan Beauty, Better By Far) - this is the value play from the stable.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Outspan barrier 12**: Widest draw in 12-horse field over 1100m. Needs luck to get across or will be forced to go back - negates his on-pace style
2. **2YO form reliability**: Limited data for all runners (max 2 starts). Speed figures and probabilities carry wider confidence intervals than established horses
3. **Weather**: Rain forecast could move track to Soft/Heavy, reshuffling the form lines. Helps Outspan but unknown for several debutantes

## EXPERT CONSENSUS

| Horse | Sources | Support |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Miss Chanel | 3/3 | 100% (Best Bet) |
| Outspan | 2/3 | 67% |
| Sequinned | 2/3 | 67% |
| Ciaron's Star | 1/3 | 33% |

Expert consensus strongly favours Miss Chanel but at $2.80 she's priced as an underlay. Outspan and Sequinned split support for the value alternative.
