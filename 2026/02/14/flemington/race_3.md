## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sass Appeal posted 82.87s for 1400m at this C&D last start - fastest recent time in field. Ole Dancer's Sandown 1400m (83.59s) also strong but 118 days ago.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Only 7 runners, likely genuine tempo without excessive pressure. On-pace runners favoured in small fields.
**Class**: Ole Dancer the class standout (1000 Guineas winner) dropping back significantly. Sass Appeal steps up from BM70 win here. Custom has stakes placings but inconsistent. Next Jen has black-type form (Tea Rose, Furious) but well beaten.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). No significant rail or style advantage detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Sass Appeal** is the top-rated runner (57.5 score, VALUE tier) on the strength of her perfect 1400m record (2/2), proven C&D form (won here last start by 1.75L), barrier 1, Damian Lane/Danny O'Brien combination, and 27-day freshness. However, at $2.20 she is 16.4% underlay to her assessed 38% win probability (fair odds $2.63). **Ole Dancer** is the class horse (1000 Guineas) but resuming after 118 days off a 3rd in a jump out - the fitness question marks see her rated WATCH at $2.25 (fair odds $3.33).

This is a two-horse race on paper but both are too short. If Sass Appeal drifts to $2.80+ she becomes a genuine VALUE play. Monitor market.

## KEY RISKS

1. Ole Dancer's class may overwhelm fitness concerns - if she runs close to her Guineas form, she wins easily
2. Rain forecast could shift track to Soft, benefiting Custom (1/4 on soft, maiden winner on soft) and Next Jen (only win on soft)

## MARKET WATCH

- **Sass Appeal**: Fair odds $2.63 - needs to drift from $2.20 for value
- **Ole Dancer**: Fair odds $3.33 - would need $3.50+ to consider
- **Custom**: Fair odds $6.25 - marginal at $5.50, EW no value at 1/4 terms
