## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Immortal Star posted the best raw times this prep - 68.78s for 1200m at Flemington (BM84 win) converts to a high-80s speed figure, clearly top of this field. Mystic Reign ran 62.54s for 1100m at Flemington in January which is competitive but came 5th.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No confirmed leader. Perilous Fighter and Photograph likely to press forward. Immortal Star can settle midfield and finish over the top as demonstrated in recent wins. 1100m sprint should suit Mystic Reign's natural speed if she jumps cleanly.

**Class**: Immortal Star dropping from BM84 win - clear class edge. Mystic Reign has the highest peak rating (won Open 3YO quality at Flemington in Mar '25 in 63.67s) but has been well below that this prep. Tango Jewel and Jakivy rising from BM66 level - big step up.

**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Good 4 surface with rain around - may deteriorate. Immortal Star has strong wet track credentials (2 wins, 3 places from 5 soft starts). Photograph is a heavy track specialist (2/2 heavy) but 0/5 on good.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**No bet recommended.** Immortal Star (#2) is the clear top-rated runner with form figures of 1-1-2-1 from last 4 genuine starts, a BM84 Flemington win, inside barrier, and Ciaron Maher in top form. However, at $2.70 the market knows this - fair odds calculate at $3.12, making this a 13.6% underlay. The market is efficiently priced.

**Mystic Reign (#7)** offers the most interesting angle as an EW prospect - her EW EV is marginally positive (+1.8%) driven by strong place EV (+12.5%) and a 45% place probability. However, her recent form (5th, 6th, 7th this prep) is deeply concerning despite having won at this track/distance. She needs significant improvement to justify a bet at current odds. **If she drifts to $8.50+, the EW value becomes actionable.**

**Tango Jewel (#5)** is a career place machine (82% place rate, specialist score 3.098) but is stepping up sharply from BM66 class and has zero Flemington experience. Place-only angle at $2.30+ has marginal appeal.

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

| Horse | Place Rate | Specialist Score | Classification |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Tango Jewel | 82% | 3.098 | STRONG SPECIALIST |
| Perilous Fighter | 48% | 1.681 | STRONG SPECIALIST |

## KEY RISKS

1. **Immortal Star dominance** - may win by a wide margin, compressing place payouts
2. **Rain threat** - Good 4 may deteriorate; benefits Photograph/Immortal Star, hurts Perilous Fighter (0/9 soft)
3. **Mystic Reign form** - 3 consecutive sub-par runs this prep despite talent; may need more time

## RED FLAGS

- #1 Photograph: Resuming 76 days, 0/5 on good ground, poor recent form (x6446)
- #7 Mystic Reign: 3 poor runs this prep (5th, 6th, 7th) - well below ability
- #5 Tango Jewel: First Flemington start, stepping up 2+ class levels
- #4 Umgawa: Wide barrier, poor form, better suited 1200m+

## GREEN LIGHTS

- #2 Immortal Star: Back-to-back wins, class drop from BM84, inside draw, hot stable
- #7 Mystic Reign: Proven C/D winner (1/3 Flem, 2/4 at 1100m), good barrier
- #5 Tango Jewel: Exceptional place consistency (82%), light weight (54kg)
