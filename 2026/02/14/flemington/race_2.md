# Flemington R2 | 2000m BM78
Sat 14 Feb | 12:35pm | 16r | Good 4

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Market fully efficient. Fiorenot is the clear top-rated runner but $3.40 offers no edge (fair odds $4.17). No EW value qualifies at current prices despite strong place specialist profiles.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited time data for direct comparison; Fiorenot's 107.83s at 1800m Flemington (BM70) is the standout figure, though untested at 2000m. Taka Speed improving rapidly but figures achieved at lower grades (BM62-66).
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. No dominant leaders; Tarvue and Chasing Aphrodite likely to settle near the speed. Should suit on-pace runners with mid-race fitness. 16-runner field adds pressure.
**Class**: Fiorenot rising from BM70 after B2B wins - trajectory is strong but jumping 2 grades. Taka Speed faces a massive class rise (BM66 to BM78) with zero course/distance experience. Tarvue drops from BM100 which is the best class indicator.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Good 4 surface, no significant rail or style advantages detected.

## PLACE SPECIALIST ANALYSIS

Three strong place specialists identified in this field:
- **#11 Trapalanda** (3.31 score) - 69.2% career place rate vs 20.9% expected. Place EV +5% at boosted prob. EW score 44.3 (just below VALUE).
- **#8 Taka Speed** (3.13 score) - 83.3% career place rate vs 26.6% expected. Just 6 starts limits sample but consistency is elite.
- **#6 Fiorenot** (1.95 score) - 88.9% career place rate vs 45.6% expected. Already reflected in short price.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Fiorenot is clearly the best horse in this race - 2 from 2 at Flemington, 89% place rate, rising through grades with authority under J Childs for the in-form Dabernig stable. However, at $3.40 in a 16-runner BM78, the price offers zero mathematical edge (fair odds $4.17). The market has this horse correctly assessed.

The place specialist profiles of Trapalanda ($7.50) and Taka Speed ($6.00) are intriguing but fall short of VALUE threshold (EW scores 44.3 and 47.0 respectively). If Fiorenot drifts to $4.00+ or Trapalanda to $9.00+, re-evaluate.

## KEY RISKS

1. Fiorenot untested at 2000m (only raced 2040m once for 4th) - staying query at short price
2. Taka Speed facing massive class jump (BM66 to BM78) with wide barrier (14) in 16-runner field
3. Competitive BM78 with 16 runners creates high variance - genuine upset potential
