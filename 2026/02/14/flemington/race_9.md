# Flemington R9 | 1400m BM88
Sat 14 Feb | 4:50pm | 11r | Good 4 | Rain | 9C

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Dominant favourite Sixties is a clear underlay at $1.80 (fair odds $2.22, edge -19%). No other runner offers sufficient value to justify a position. Marginal EW on Romantic Encounter (+0.6%) insufficient to act.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sixties has the best time figures - 69.09s for 1200m (BM88 Rosehill, 1.68L margin) and Ming Dynasty winner at 1400m in 83.26s. Clear top-rated on raw times. West Of Swindon next best via Exford Plate/Carbine Club performances but hasn't raced in 104 days.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Asakura and Loud Charlie likely to roll forward from mid-draws. Sixties has tactical versatility (settled 3rd-5th range). West Of Swindon has sat on-pace in better races. Shape should suit Sixties who can track the speed and kick.

**Class**: Sixties is the clear class standout - Ming Dynasty Stakes (Listed) winner who then won a BM88 by 1.68L. West Of Swindon competed in Carbine Club (G3) and Caulfield Guineas (G1). Asakura rising sharply from BM66 provincial level. Most others have significant class queries at BM88 metro.

**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Good 4 rail position not specified. Rain forecast may see track deteriorate - would favour Sixties (1W/1P from 1 heavy start, handles all ground) and Bingi (2W/3P from 3 soft starts). Could disadvantage Asakura (untested wet).

## KEY RISKS

1. Sixties' wide barrier (11) in an 11-runner field - needs luck from out wide, though Damian Lane is capable of overcoming this
2. Rain may deteriorate the track beyond Good 4, reshuffling wet-track form credentials

## EW ASSESSMENT

| # | Horse | Odds | EW EV | Place EV | Rating |
|---|-------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | West Of Swindon | $8.00 | -3.9% | -3.8% | NO VALUE |
| 6 | Romantic Encounter | $14.00 | +0.6% | +3.3% | MARGINAL |
| 5 | Officiate | $19.00 | +2.5% | +10.0% | MARGINAL |

Romantic Encounter and Officiate show marginal EW figures but confidence is too low to recommend action. Both have fitness/distance unknowns.
