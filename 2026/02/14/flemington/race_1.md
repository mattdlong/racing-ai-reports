## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Zambales only runner with genuine race time data (2nd at Randwick 1000m, 57.92s winner); insufficient data to generate reliable speed figures for debutants.
**Pace**: UNCERTAIN - 5 debutants make pace scenario impossible to predict; Zambales raced on-pace previously, Hard Kick won 3 jump-outs suggesting natural speed.
**Class**: 2YO restricted race at metro level ($29,200 prizemoney); Zambales has raced in 2Y HCP at Randwick, slight class edge over field.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence); rail position not reported; Good 4 with rain - conditions could deteriorate.

## RUNNER PROFILES

**#1 Zambales ($2.25)** - A&S Freedman / Stackhouse. Only runner with race form: 2nd at Randwick 1000m (24/01, 1.44L off winner). Also won barrier trial at Randwick 1050m. Stepping up to 1100m at Flemington first time. Clear form standout but $2.25 too short - fair odds ~$2.63.

**#4 Hard Kick ($4.00)** - Hayes / Lane. Debut. Won all 3 jump-outs (most recently 06/02). Damian Lane booking significant for a debutant. Well-drawn barrier 4. Market support suggests stable confidence. Key danger.

**#5 Shah Jahan ($4.50)** - Maher / Brown. Debut. Two jump-outs only (2nd and 3rd). Ciaron Maher powerful with debutant 2yos historically. Barrier 3 suits. Market too short relative to unknowns at $4.50.

**#3 Diameter ($8.00)** - Waller / McNeil. One race start: 5th in Maribyrnong Plate (Flemington 1000m, Soft) 101 days ago. Won recent jump-out. Long absence a concern but has Flemington experience.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No selections recommended. While Zambales is the clear form horse in this field, $2.25 represents a -14.5% underlay against our assessed 38% win probability (fair odds $2.63). The race is dominated by unraced runners making probability estimation unreliable. Hard Kick at $4.00 has appeal with the Lane booking and strong trial form, but without raceday data the confidence is too low to bet at -12% edge. This is a watching brief only.

## KEY RISKS

1. 5/7 debutants - probability estimates carry extreme uncertainty
2. Rain forecast - Good 4 could shift to Soft, unknown wet form for entire field
3. Low data quality (MEDIUM) - expert tips from only 1 source
