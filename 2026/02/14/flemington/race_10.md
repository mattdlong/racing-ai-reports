*(#11 Princess Que - SCRATCHED)*

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Philia has the highest raw ability (Listed winner, 4 straight wins pre-spell) but untested at Flemington. Wrote To Arataki won well at Caulfield 1200m last start. Grid Girl ran 82.32s winning BM94 at Rosehill 1400m - the benchmark time.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No confirmed leaders; Philia and Samangu likely to be forward. Wrote To Arataki can stalk from inside draw. Grid Girl settles back and relies on sustained run - needs some pace to chase.

**Class**: Philia (Princess Stakes winner) and Too Darn Discreet (BM84/BM100 form) have the class edge. Grid Girl has proven BM94 form (won at Rosehill). Samangu stepping up from 1200m BM90 - untried at 1400m is the key unknown. Paradise City rising sharply from BM74.

**Bias**: No significant bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. Neutral assessment across all barriers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Samangu (EW)**: Elite place specialist (4.17 score, 70% career place rate) at $16. The win edge is +12% with EW_EV of +8.3%. While untried at 1400m, his 5/10 win record and exceptional consistency suggest he'll run a race. The Grahame Begg/Jordan Childs combination is solid and he won well first-up at Caulfield. Key risk is the 1400m trip.

**Grid Girl (EW)**: Proven 1400m performer (5/11 at distance) with a BM94 win already on the CV (Rosehill, Dec 2025). Place specialist score of 1.72 with 58% career place rate. The +5% win edge is marginal but the EW composite at +4.2% provides a playable spot. Wide barrier (10) in a 10-horse field is manageable. Three consecutive wins before a freshen suggest she's in the right form cycle.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Philia** at $4.20 is the danger - a class above if fit after 251 days, but the price reflects that upside; no value at current odds
2. **Rain forecast** - track could deteriorate to Soft. Samangu (0/1 Soft) and Grid Girl handle it, but Wrote To Arataki (3/10 Soft) would be advantaged further
