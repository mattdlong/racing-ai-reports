## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Fission posted the fastest Flemington 1200m time (68.78s) two starts back at BM84 level; Rue De Royale won in 69.65s at lower BM70 class. Ndola's best 1200m form is from provincial tracks but progressing sharply.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - no confirmed leader. Ndola and Fission likely sit midfield; Rue De Royale can roll forward from barrier 2. Shape suits on-pace runners.
**Class**: All bar Pounding and Highlights are rising in class to BM94. Ndola (33% career win rate, 73% place) handles class rises best. Fission won BM74 two back and placed 3rd in BM84 last start - progressive. Rue De Royale's only win was at BM70, significant jump to BM94.
**Bias**: Neutral bias at Flemington on Good 4, low confidence. Rain around may not impact the track rating.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Ndola** is the standout EW proposition. Rising 4yo with a 33% win rate and 73% place rate (place specialist score 1.39). Two consecutive 2nd placings at BM84, the 7th in the V Gold Bullion (soft track, stronger field) is forgivable. Drops back to 1200m where he has 3 wins from 5 starts. The $4.80 offers +5.6% edge with strong EW EV of +11.3%.

**Fission** offers the best raw edge at +10.5%. Strong place specialist (score 2.02 - 63% place rate vs 31% expected). Won at Flemington 1200m two back (BM74) then placed 3rd in BM84. The class rise to BM94 is a query but the 54kg weight helps and barrier 4 is ideal. EW EV +9.2%.

**Rue De Royale** is the clear favourite at $2.70 but represents an UNDERLAY at -19% edge. Only win at BM70 level - massive class jump to BM94. Jamie Kah booking and barrier 2 are the positives but the price doesn't compensate for the risk.

## KEY RISKS

1. Ndola stepping back to 1200m after racing over 1400m - may need further than the sprint trip
2. Fission rising two classes (BM74 → BM94) in one step, untested at this level
3. Rain forecast could shift track to Soft, altering form lines (Ndola 0/5 on soft)

## EW VALUE DETAIL

| Horse | Win% | Place% | Win EV | Place EV | EW EV | Specialist |
|-------|------|--------|--------|----------|-------|------------|
| Ndola | 22% | 60.1% | +5.6% | +17.0% | +11.3% | 1.39 |
| Fission | 13% | 37.5% | +10.5% | +7.8% | +9.2% | 2.02 |

## EXPERT CONSENSUS

Rue De Royale heavily favoured by tipsters (~75% support). Ndola, Great Maximus, and Fission secondary picks. Market respects Rue De Royale but our model finds value underneath.
