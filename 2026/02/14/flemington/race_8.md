## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Tentyris (#4) has the best raw time credentials (Coolmore 68.1/1200m, 2.25L clear) but first run at 1000m and untested on rain-affected ground. Giga Kick (#1) proven at this distance with 57.53s/1000m at BM90+ level.

**Pace**: FAST expected. Small field with multiple on-pace runners (Giga Kick, Tentyris, Beiwacht) will ensure genuine speed. Stalkers/closers (Marhoona, My Gladiola) should benefit if the speed runners knock each other out.

**Class**: Entire field dropping significantly - multiple Group 1/2 performers contesting a BM90. Tentyris (Coolmore Stud winner), Giga Kick (VRC Sprint), Baraqiel (Moir Stakes) all well above this grade. However, the weight of class is factored into odds - the value lies elsewhere.

**Bias**: Neutral (LOW confidence). No significant style or barrier bias detected. Rain forecast may soften track further.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Marhoona (#6) EW @ $13**: The standout each-way proposition. She qualifies via Path A (Value Overlay: odds $13 >= $6, EW EV +21.7% >= +5%, place prob 32% >= 30%) AND Path B (Place Specialist: score 4.63, 100% placing rate from 5 starts). She's a lightly-raced 3yo filly with a perfect placing record, won her barrier trial stylishly, and sits perfectly as a stalker in a race with genuine speed. First time at Flemington and 1000m are the risks, but the Freedman stable knows what they're doing stepping her up to open company. At $13 she represents the best value in the race.

**Giga Kick (#1) WIN @ $4.50**: Marginal win value (+8% edge) from a proven Group sprinter dropping to BM90 level. Won the VRC Sprint at Flemington, trialled well, and has strong Flemington record (3/5). The concern is 97 days off and the wide barrier (6 of 8), but in a small field this is manageable. At $4.50 he's not an overlay on talent alone but offers slight value given the class drop.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Rain impact**: Track currently Good 4 with rain forecast. Tentyris and Marhoona have zero soft/heavy track form. If track deteriorates, Giga Kick (4/8 soft, 1/1 heavy) and Baraqiel (4/6 soft) are advantaged.
2. **Tentyris first-up at 1000m**: The $2.50 favourite has never raced at 1000m and is first-up from 104 days. While supremely talented, he's a -15% underlay at current odds - no value.
3. **Freshness queries**: Multiple runners (Baraqiel 140d, Marhoona 125d, Tentyris/Beiwacht 104d) returning from extended breaks. First-up fitness is a genuine concern across the field.

## EACH-WAY DETAIL

| Horse | Win EV | Place EV | EW EV | Specialist | Path |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|------------|------|
| Marhoona | +17.0% | +26.4% | +21.7% | 4.63 STRONG | A+B |
| Giga Kick | +8.0% | +21.9% | +14.9% | 1.29 Normal | - |
| Beiwacht | +5.0% | +5.0% | +5.0% | - | A (marginal) |
| My Gladiola | -17.5% | -8.1% | -12.8% | 3.33 STRONG | - |
