## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sabaj holds the best figures (90) from Cranbourne Cup and Flemington BM84 wins; Matcha Latte (88) and Cafe Millenium (86) competitive at 1400m.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - no obvious leaders; Sabaj and Cafe Millenium likely settle on-pace from inside draws, Enxuto can stalk from midfield.
**Class**: Enxuto (92) and Birdman (95) have the highest class ratings from Group-level placings (Linlithgow, Ingham), but Enxuto far more proven at this distance than Birdman.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence) - no significant advantage to any running style or barrier position.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Enxuto at $12 represents genuine each-way value. His 3rd in the G3 Linlithgow (81.62s/1400m) and 2nd in the Cranbourne Cup behind Sabaj demonstrate he belongs in this class. He's a confirmed STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score 2.0) with a 48% career place rate against an expected 24% - double the expected rate. Two jump outs this prep suggest he's ready to fire second-up equivalent. The $12 odds provide +20% win edge and +14% combined EW EV, with both win (+20%) and place (+8%) components in positive territory. The top two in the market (Sabaj at $3.20, Justadeel at $4.00) are both underlays at -10% to -12% edge.

## KEY RISKS

1. First-up from 62-day break off two jump outs - fitness may not be peak for 1400m
2. Barrier 8 of 9 means he'll need to be ridden conservatively, relying on late speed

## EW METRICS

| Horse | Win EV | Place EV | EW EV | Place% | Specialist |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| Enxuto | +20.0% | +8.0% | +14.0% | 28.8% | 2.0 STRONG |
| Cafe Millenium | +5.0% | -4.7% | +0.1% | 37.8% | - |
| Justadeel | -12.0% | -2.9% | -11.4% | 55.5% | 1.42 |
