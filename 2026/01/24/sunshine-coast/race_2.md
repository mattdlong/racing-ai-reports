## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Enterprise Private strongest recent figures - won BM78 at Doomben (2200m) by 1.1L just 9 days ago, with consecutive wins prior.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Let Fly and Enterprise Private likely to race on-pace; 2200m favours runners who can sustain tempo without burning early.

**Class**: Enterprise Private rising sharply (BM58 to BM78) but form justifies - 3 wins from 5 starts at 2200m. Prince Levi steady at class but 0/1 at trip.

**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain continuing. Enterprise Private 2/8 on soft (25% SW), Texas Fireball 3/11 (27% SW). Both handle give. Prince Levi 0/4 on soft - significant concern.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Enterprise Private is the class horse in form. Won at this course and distance (C1 D3 record), coming off a commanding 1.1L win at Doomben over the same trip 9 days ago. Daniel Moor retains the ride. The rise in class is sharp but justified by recent form trajectory - 3 wins from last 5 starts including a 4.45L romp at this track. Barrier 4 is ideal. The only concern is the quick backup but this horse thrives on racing.

## KEY RISKS

1. Quick backup (9 days) after peak effort - watch betting drift
2. Class rise from BM66 to BM78 - first test at this level

## MARKET WATCH

Prince Levi (FAV $3.70) ran 3rd to Enterprise Private last start, beaten 1.1L. Gets 0.5kg better but that run was on Good ground - has 0/4 record on soft. Market overstating chances given track condition.

Texas Fireball ($5.50) strong place specialist (70.8% consistency) but wide barrier (10) is a concern at 2200m on a wet track. Better placed each-way than for the win.
