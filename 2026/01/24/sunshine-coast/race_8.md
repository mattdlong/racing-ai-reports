## EDGE TABLE

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Rockribbed has best recent figures (82.16s/1400m Soft at Eagle Farm), back-to-back wins prior suggest peak fitness.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - #1 Rockribbed and #14 Esjay likely to settle midfield, #6 Anemacore on speed from barrier 3. Shape suits on-pace runners.

**Class**: Open Quality/Listed class - #1 Rockribbed proven at this level with 2 wins from last 3 starts. #6 Anemacore rising after 2 straight wins but untested at top level.

**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence - Soft 5 with rain favors proven wet-trackers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**ROCKRIBBED** shapes as the value play at $8.50. The 8yo Gollan-trained gelding has strong Soft track form (5 wins, 7 places from 11 starts on Soft) and is proven at this distance (3 wins from 10 starts at 1400m). Last start 4th in The Buffering (less than 1L from winner) represents solid form reference. The 59% career place rate (19 placings from 32 starts) makes EW the optimal bet structure. Barrier 8 is neutral.

**OUGHTON** as secondary EW play offers value at $17.00. The 7yo has exceptional place consistency (55% place rate) and course experience (2 starts at Sunshine Coast including 2nd last July). Soft track form is solid (2 wins, 6 places from 8 Soft starts). Wide barrier 5 workable from outside draw.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Anemacore** ($4.20 fav) - Excellent C/D record (2 wins from 4 at Sunshine Coast) and in-form, may be deserving favorite despite short price
2. **Esjay** ($6.00) - Rampant form (4 wins from last 6), coming off BM90 win, but big class rise to Listed and has just 1 win from 18 at 1400m
3. **Soft 5 + Rain** - Track may deteriorate further, suits proven wet-trackers

## WET TRACK CREDENTIALS

| # | Horse | Soft W-P | Heavy W-P | Rating |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Rockribbed | 5-7/11 | 1-2/4 | PROVEN |
| 6 | Anemacore | 1-3/4 | 0-1/2 | OKAY |
| 5 | Pereille | 2-8/12 | 1-3/3 | PROVEN |
| 14 | Esjay | 1-7/18 | 1-2/3 | OKAY |
| 2 | Oughton | 2-6/8 | 0-0/2 | QUERY |

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market percentage: 128.2% (overround)
Favorite: #6 Anemacore @ $4.20 (implied 23.8%)

The market underrates Rockribbed's wet track credentials and overrates Anemacore's progressive form given this represents a significant class test. Esjay is short considering the 1400m distance query (1/18 at trip) despite excellent recent form.
