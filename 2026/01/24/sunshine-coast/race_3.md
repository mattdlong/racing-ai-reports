**Scratched**: #2 Archer's Game, #7 Drialle, #10 Jenni Moreese

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Diamond Epic ($2.60) has best recent figures from BM70 win at Eagle Farm (96.63s). La Rosetta progressing quickly after soft track 1600m win.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No dominant leaders; Last Chance Saloon and La Rosetta likely to contest early. Closers have chance if pace honest.

**Class**: BM78 provincial grade. Diamond Epic and La Rosetta both rising from BM65-70 wins - class test. Okesutora has BM65 form but placed in stronger BM85 fields.

**Bias**: Neutral (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain - deteriorating track may favour on-pacers as race progresses.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Okesutora (#11)** offers genuine value at $10.00. Strong place specialist (score 1.74) with 50% career place rate. Recent form solid: 4th (2.9L) and 3rd (2.6L) at this track at 1600m in BM62-65. Step up to 1800m suits - won over 2200m at Seymour and Rockhampton earlier. Trainer Mark Currie has stable in form. Rob Thorburn retains ride after recent placings.

The favourite Diamond Epic ($2.60) is clearly talented but faces first test at 1800m (0 starts at trip), rising in class to BM78, and has modest soft track record (1/7). Fair odds ~$3.30 suggests underlay territory.

## KEY RISKS

1. **First time 1800m** - Okesutora untried at exact distance (though won 2200m)
2. **Wide barrier (9)** - May need to go back from midfield draw
3. **Soft track specialist doubt** - 2/8 on soft, better on good ground

## GREEN LIGHTS

- Strong place consistency (50% career)
- Trainer Mark Currie placing horses well
- Distance should suit based on 2200m form
- +20% edge at current odds
