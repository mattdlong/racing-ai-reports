## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Hell (#4) has the best recent figures from BM78 win at Eagle Farm (70.66s); Hatchet (#6) consistent at Open level.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - Hell and Jonny Da Wolf likely to press, Hatchet to sit midfield from barrier 4.

**Class**: Listed race attracting BM78-90 performers; no standout class edge for any runner.

**Bias**: Neutral bias expected on Soft 5; track favoring on-pace runners in wet conditions.

## WET TRACK CREDENTIALS

| # | Horse | Soft W-P/S | Soft Win% | Soft Place% |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 4 | Hell | 5-9/12 | 42% | 75% |
| 9 | Mister Bianco | 4-7/9 | 44% | 78% |
| 6 | Hatchet | 3-7/14 | 21% | 50% |
| 12 | Zouperb | 3-10/15 | 20% | 67% |
| 14 | Jonny Da Wolf | 2-6/10 | 20% | 60% |
| 5 | Battlefield | 0-2/5 | 0% | 40% |

## KEY RISKS

1. **Hell**: Wide barrier (14) could compromise in wet; market price offers no value
2. **Battlefield**: Poor soft track record (0/5) despite good recent form on good tracks
3. **Field quality**: Competitive Listed field with no standout; race could produce any result

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

The market is pricing Hell correctly at ~$3.20 (31% implied) against our assessed 28% true probability. No overlay exists on the top contenders. The 127.7% market percentage indicates an overround race with limited value opportunities.

**Hatchet** at $6.50 represents the closest to fair value (fair odds $6.67), but the lack of C/D wins is a concern.

**Jonny Da Wolf** shows strong place specialist credentials (73% career place rate) but is priced accordingly.

## RECOMMENDATION

**PASS** - Monitor market movements. If Hell drifts to $4.00+ or Hatchet to $8.00+, reassess for value. Current prices offer negative expected value across the board.
