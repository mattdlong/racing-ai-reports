# Sunshine Coast R7 | 1400m BM90
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 15r | Soft 5

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #10 KADALL @ $12.00 - 1.0u E/W**

Place specialist score 4.05 (exceptional) + 68% career place rate = strong EW proposition at double-figure odds.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|--------|------|
| 14 | Arabian Rose | $4.40 | 46.5 | 22% | -3% | 48% | VALUE |
| 7 | Mishani Crown | $5.50 | 32.5 | 16% | -12% | 35% | WATCH |
| 11 | Sultry Siren | $6.50 | 38.0 | 13% | -16% | 30% | WATCH |
| 4 | Bohemian Lad | $8.50 | 47.3 | 11% | -7% | 38% | VALUE |
| 8 | Ruins Of Rome | $12.00 | 42.0 | 10% | -4% | 27% | WATCH |
| 10 | Kadall | $12.00 | 64.2 | 8% | -4% | 45% | EW_VALUE |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Arabian Rose has best recent figures (71.49s 1200m win at course), but stepping up to 1400m.
**Pace**: MODERATE - likely honest pace with Mishani Crown and Ruins Of Rome likely to press forward.
**Class**: Mishani Crown huge class rise (BM78 to BM90); Arabian Rose progressive but untested at this level.
**Bias**: Neutral bias detected (LOW confidence). Soft 5 track with rain - wet trackers advantaged.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**KADALL** (#10) presents compelling Each-Way value via Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist). Career stats of 3 wins, 19 places from 28 starts (68% place rate) are exceptional. The 5yo gelding has 13 runs at 1400m with 2 wins and consistent placings at BM85 level. While the wide barrier (18) is concerning, Michael Rodd booking adds value. The $12 odds significantly undervalue his place credentials - expected place probability 45% vs implied ~28% from place odds of $3.60.

**WHY NOT ARABIAN ROSE**: The favorite looks vulnerable at $4.40. While she's 4 from 5 at the course, she's untested at BM90 and jumping from CL5 grade. The wide barrier (14) and step up in class represent red flags. Market appears to have her right at best.

## KEY RISKS

1. Kadall drawn barrier 18 (widest) - needs luck in running
2. Ran yesterday (0 days since last) - back-up query despite no travel
3. Soft track form: 0 wins from 10 starts (but 6 places)
