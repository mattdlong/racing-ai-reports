# Sunshine Coast R4 | 1200m BM78
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 13r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #15 VELOZES @ $9.50 - 1.0u E/W**

Qualifies Path A: Odds $9.50 >= $6, EW EV +7.0%, Place prob 32%

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sirkel (70.47s at 1200m Good) and Estrondo (69.41s at 1200m Good) hold the best recent figures. Velozes won trial 59.67s at 1000m, suggesting fitness.

**Pace**: CONTESTED - Multiple on-pace types (Estrondo, Streak Of Winning, Air We Go) should ensure honest tempo. Soft 5 track with rain will suit runners with wet track form.

**Class**: BM78 provincial. Sirkel rising from BM70 win (class rise query). Estrondo proven at BM78 level. Velozes stepping up from CL3 trial but has BM68 placed form.

**Bias**: Neutral bias detected (low confidence). Inside barriers advantageous in rain - favors Velozes (bar 1), Streak Of Winning (bar 2).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Velozes (#15)** represents value at $9.50. Won trial at Doomben 12 days ago (1000m, 59.67s), indicating fitness ahead of this return. Tony Gollan-trained mare has solid wet track credentials (0/4 Soft but 2 places) and draws perfectly in barrier 1. Career 18% win rate, 55% place rate shows consistency. At the odds, the +14% edge makes this a worthwhile each-way play. Place specialist score of 2.18 (Strong) supports the place component.

## KEY RISKS

1. First start in 142 days (long spell) - fitness query despite trial win
2. Rising in class from CL3 to BM78 (significant class jump)
3. No course form at Sunshine Coast

## MARKET LEADERS

**Sirkel (#13) $3.00** - Well-supported favorite coming off BM70 win at Eagle Farm. Class rise is the concern - jumping straight to BM78 from lower grades. Form strong (1-4-2-3) but price too short for the class query. 70% place rate from 10 starts suggests consistency but lacks win value. **WATCH - no bet.**

**Estrondo (#2) $5.00** - Proven at BM78 level (won last at this grade). Course winner at Sunshine Coast (2 from 4). Daniel Moor riding. Barrier 10 a negative in rain. Fair value only at $5.00. **WATCH.**

**Streak Of Winning (#6) $6.50** - 40% win rate (4/10) is standout. Inside barrier 2 suits. Won last two starts at lower levels (CL3). Untested at BM78 - class rise query. Heavy track form (1/1) is positive for deteriorating conditions. **WATCH - respect.**
