# Sunshine Coast R10 | 1000m BM78
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 13r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #6 THE FIXER @ $26.00 - 1.5u E/W**

**EW VALUE: #7 PORT ERIN @ $11.00 - 1.0u E/W**

**NO WIN BET** - Favorite Yoyo Yeezy ($1.80) offers no value at compressed odds.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Bet |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-----|
| 14 | Yoyo Yeezy | 1.80 | 56 | 45% | -19% | UNDERLAY | - |
| 8 | Vindicta | 6.00 | 52 | 14% | -16% | WATCH | - |
| 3 | Power Of The Brave | 7.50 | 48 | 12% | -10% | WATCH | - |
| 13 | Moonhaven | 7.50 | 44 | 10% | -10% | WATCH | - |
| 7 | Port Erin | 11.00 | 54 | 10% | +10% | EW VALUE | 1.0u |
| 6 | The Fixer | 26.00 | 78 | 8% | +108% | EW VALUE | 1.5u |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Yoyo Yeezy has fastest raw figures (56.79s last start at Eagle Farm 1000m) but untested at this venue. Power Of The Brave won at Randwick in 56.85s on Boxing Day.

**Pace**: FAST expected - multiple speed types (Yoyo Yeezy, Vindicta, Laydownlily) will contest the lead. This sets up well for on-pacers and stalkers.

**Class**: BM78 provincial. Yoyo Yeezy stepping up significantly from BM70/CL3 level - big class test. The Fixer and Port Erin both proven at this level.

**Bias**: Soft 5 track with Rain. The Fixer has 4 wins from 6 soft starts (67%) - outstanding wet track specialist. Port Erin 1/6 on soft but placed 4 times (67% place rate).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**The Fixer** is the standout EW value at $26. Exceptional wet track record (4/6 soft, 67% win rate), long spell but 2nd in recent trial at Doomben. At this price, the value is enormous with a 3.69 place specialist score. The 182-day layoff is the key risk, but trainer Jack Bruce has Vindicta also in this race, suggesting stable is primed.

**Port Erin** qualifies via Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist). Outstanding 67% career place rate (10/15) and proven at BM75 level at Eagle Farm. Wide barrier (17) is a concern but this horse has placed from wide draws before. At $11, offers genuine EW value.

## KEY RISKS

1. Yoyo Yeezy - class-bound progressive type may simply be too good despite short odds
2. Both EW selections drawn wide (barriers 13 and 17) in a 13-runner field
