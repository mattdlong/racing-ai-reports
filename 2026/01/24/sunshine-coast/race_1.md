# Sunshine Coast R1 | 1000m 2YO
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 8r | Soft 5

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Skinny favorite offers no value; limited form depth in juvenile field

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Star Of Jamaica | $1.70 | 49.3 | 48% | -18% | VALUE | - |
| 5 | On The Clock | $4.80 | 38.6 | 17% | -2% | WATCH | - |
| 6 | Cause She Can | $6.00 | 33.1 | 14% | -6% | WATCH | - |
| 3 | Dustee | $9.00 | 30.2 | 9% | -10% | PASS | - |
| 4 | Harry's Back | $14.00 | 28.0 | 6% | -16% | PASS | - |
| 2 | Chayse 'N' Pop | $16.00 | 25.5 | 5% | -20% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Star Of Jamaica (#1) has the only meaningful race form at 1000m, finishing 2nd at Eagle Farm in 57.92s - benchmark for this field of largely unraced juveniles.

**Pace**: MODERATE - expect On The Clock (#5) and Star Of Jamaica (#1) to contest the lead from inside draws; both showed early speed in trials.

**Class**: First-starters dominate (6 of 8 runners), making form assessment unreliable; Star Of Jamaica's metro placing is the class standard.

**Bias**: Rail position unknown; track bias confidence LOW; soft 5 track suits runners with wet form.

## FIELD ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Form | Trainer | Wet Form | Notes |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Star Of Jamaica | 3 | $1.70 | 2 | Munce | 0-1-1 | 2nd Eagle Farm 1000m; 2 trial wins |
| 2 | Chayse 'N' Pop | 2 | $16.00 | - | Bellamy | 0-0-0 | Trial win Beaudesert; weak field |
| 3 | Dustee | 5 | $9.00 | - | Price/Kent | 0-0-0 | VIC raider; 3rd Warwick Farm BT |
| 4 | Harry's Back | 4 | $14.00 | - | McLean | 0-0-0 | Trial win Beaudesert; tiny margin |
| 5 | On The Clock | 6 | $4.80 | - | Birchley | 0-0-0 | Strong Eagle Farm trial; good speed |
| 6 | Cause She Can | 1 | $6.00 | 1 | Kemp | 0-0-0 | Won Toowoomba MDN; untested on wet |
| 7 | Canya Zipit | 7 | $81.00 | - | Clark-peoples | 0-0-0 | Weak trial; major query |
| 8 | Hot Image | 8 | $126.00 | - | Tyrell | 0-0-0 | Trial form; outclassed |

## CONTENDER PROFILES

### #1 STAR OF JAMAICA ($1.70)
**Positives**: Only runner with race experience at 1000m; 2nd to useful type at Eagle Farm; won two trials impressively; Munce stable in good form; barrier 3 suits; proven on soft ground.

**Negatives**: Market price ($1.70) implies 59% probability but true win probability closer to 48% based on juvenile form volatility; first-up form unreliable in 2YO races; price offers no margin for error.

**Assessment**: Most likely winner but severe underlay at current odds. Edge: -18%.

### #5 ON THE CLOCK ($4.80)
**Positives**: Impressive Eagle Farm 800m trial win (2.1L margin); Birchley stable capable with juveniles; showed natural early speed; slight easing in market creates minor interest.

**Negatives**: First starter stepping straight to 1000m; untested on soft; barrier 6 not ideal but workable in small field; trial speed may not carry to race.

**Assessment**: Main danger if able to replicate trial form. Edge: -2% (borderline).

### #6 CAUSE SHE CAN ($6.00)
**Positives**: Race winner (Toowoomba maiden); proven ability to complete 1000m; rails barrier; 2kg weight advantage as filly.

**Negatives**: Won in weaker company (Toowoomba vs metro); untested on soft track; country form rarely translates to coast class.

**Assessment**: Place chance only. Edge: -6%.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Juvenile volatility** - Six first-starters make race highly unpredictable; any debutant could outperform trials
2. **Value-free favorite** - Star Of Jamaica must win to justify odds; any mishap = loss
3. **Unknown wet form** - Most runners untested on soft ground; track could deteriorate

## RECOMMENDATION

**PASS** - No value identified in this juvenile event. Star Of Jamaica (#1) is the most likely winner but at $1.70 represents an 18% underlay based on form assessment. The field lacks the form depth required for confident edge assessment, and the predominance of first-starters introduces unquantifiable risk.

If forced to identify a value angle: **On The Clock (#5)** at $4.80 represents the closest to fair value (edge -2%) with upside if able to transfer trial form to race day. Not actionable as formal selection.
