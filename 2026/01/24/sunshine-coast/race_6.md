## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Bang Stick posted best recent figure (82) winning by 3.4L at Townsville on soft.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected; inside barriers advantaged with rail-true.
**Class**: Rising from provincial 3YO company but has the best soft track form in field.
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected; no strong leader or closer advantage.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Bang Stick (#3) represents strong each-way value at $8.50. This lightly-raced 3yo has exceptional wet track credentials (3 wins, 5 places from 6 soft track starts - 50% win rate). Coming off an impressive 3.4L win at Townsville stepping up to 1400m, he drops back to 1200m where he won at Mackay on soft. The inside barrier (2) is a major asset in a 14-runner field on rain-affected ground. Trainer Tom Button has the gelding in career-best form with a 40% career win strike rate and 70% place rate. The EW EV of +19.1% with place probability of 38.5% qualifies via Path A (Value Overlay).

## KEY RISKS

1. First start at Sunshine Coast - no course experience
2. Wide draws (10-14) for several main rivals could compress inside
