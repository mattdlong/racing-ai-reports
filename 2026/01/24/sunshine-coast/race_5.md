Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 9r | Soft 5 | Rain

**EW VALUE: #9 CAPITAL ASSET @ $8.50 - 1.0u E/W**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Tier | Notes |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|------|-------|
| 7 | Nails Murphy | 7 | $3.60 | 28% | 68% | -1% | VALUE | Fav, best form |
| 9 | Capital Asset | 11 | $8.50 | 12% | 36% | +2% | EW_VALUE | C/D record |

| 10 | Katdeel | 2 | $16.00 | 6% | 21% | -4% | PASS | Outclassed |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Nails Murphy has the best recent speed figures, clocking 98.67s on soft here last start.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - Capital Asset and Cunnamulla Fella likely to press from good draws. Suits on-pace types.

**Class**: BM85 level appropriate for top 4 runners. Capital Asset rising after BM78 win - trajectory positive.

**Bias**: LOW confidence in bias data. Neutral expected on soft 5.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Capital Asset (#9) qualifies as Each-Way Value via Path B (Place Specialist) at $8.50. Won last start at this course (Sunshine Coast, 1800m Soft) by nearly 1 length, demonstrating his affinity for the track and conditions. His course record is outstanding - 2 wins from 3 starts. The step up to BM85 from BM78 is manageable off that career-best win. Wide barrier (11) is a concern in 9-horse field but the softer pace should allow him to find a position.

Nails Murphy (#7) is the rightful favourite with exceptional recent form (1-2-3-2-2-1) and won at this track/distance 28 days ago. However, the $3.60 price offers no edge and doesn't qualify as a Best Bet (insufficient expert support at 33%). Watch only.

## KEY RISKS

1. Capital Asset's wide barrier (11) in small field may force wide run
2. First run at 1600m - untested at the distance (previous course wins at 1400m)
3. Nails Murphy is the class runner and clearly best on form

## PLACE SPECIALIST NOTES

| # | Horse | Actual Place% | Expected | Specialist Score |
|---|-------|---------------|----------|------------------|
| 4 | Cunnamulla Fella | 67% | 34% | 1.99 STRONG |
| 3 | Demon Darb | 67% | 36% | 1.86 STRONG |
| 7 | Nails Murphy | 85% | 67% | 1.27 NORMAL |

Cunnamulla Fella and Demon Darb are both strong place specialists but lack the odds value required for EW qualification.

## SOFT TRACK FORM

Critical for Soft 5 conditions:

| # | Horse | Soft Wins | Soft Places | Soft Win% |
|---|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 3 | Demon Darb | 5 | 6 | 38% |
| 4 | Cunnamulla Fella | 4 | 7 | 36% |
| 9 | Capital Asset | 2 | 5 | 20% |
| 7 | Nails Murphy | 1 | 4 | 13% |

Demon Darb and Cunnamulla Fella have the best wet form but are priced too short to offer value. Capital Asset has adequate soft form and better odds.
