## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Madhi Girl has strong recent form with 4 straight wins before Miss Andretti; Jaz Session also showing good figures with Epona Classic win.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - several on-pace types including Madhi Girl, Jaz Session. Cut The Talk likely to settle midfield and finish strongly.

**Class**: BM72 level suits most runners. Madhi Girl rising after dominant lower grade wins. Jaz Session has shown BM66 form.

**Bias**: Neutral bias expected. SOFT 5 track is the critical factor - Madhi Girl (4/5 soft), Triple Jay (4/7 soft) have strong wet records. Jaz Session (0/2) and Sky Duke (0/6) major concerns on this surface.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Madhi Girl** is the logical top pick given her outstanding soft track record (4 wins from 5 starts) and recent purple patch of 4 consecutive victories before a creditable 5th in the Miss Andretti Stakes against superior opposition. She drops back to BM72 company with barrier 3 offering tactical advantage. However, at $3.20 she is fair value at best with no positive edge identified.

**Jaz Session** is market favourite but her 0/2 soft track record (with just 1 place from 2 starts) is a significant concern. Her excellent course form (4/12 Ascot wins) and recent Epona Classic victory are offset by the unknown on this surface.

**Cut The Talk** is the place specialist play (65% career place rate, 1.69 specialist score) but lacks win value at $4.80.

## KEY RISKS

1. Soft 5 track condition creates significant form reversals - Jaz Session and Sky Duke compromised
2. Madhi Girl stepping up to 1200m with 0/3 record at the trip (though 2/5 on soft suggests she handles conditions)
3. Limited expert consensus (only 1 source checked) reduces confidence

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market is pricing Jaz Session ($2.90) and Madhi Girl ($3.20) close together. Given soft track records:
- Madhi Girl: 80% soft win rate vs $3.20 (31% implied)
- Jaz Session: 0% soft win rate vs $2.90 (34% implied)

The market appears to be underweighting track condition impact. Madhi Girl should be shorter than Jaz Session on this surface.
