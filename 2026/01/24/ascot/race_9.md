# Ascot R9 | 1600m BM66
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 13r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #7 IMPRESSIVE JEWEL @ $13.00 - 1.5u E/W**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|------|
| 6 | Triple The Chant | $2.80 | 32% | -10% | 76% | VALUE |
| 8 | Antique Queen | $5.50 | 15% | -18% | 38% | WATCH |
| 14 | Southern Firetail | $6.50 | 12% | -22% | 32% | WATCH |
| 1 | Deamber | $7.00 | 14% | -2% | 37% | WATCH |
| 2 | Great Fortune | $8.50 | 11% | -7% | 29% | WATCH |
| 7 | Impressive Jewel | $13.00 | 10% | +30% | 30% | EW_VALUE |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Triple The Chant has the best recent figures but all 3 wins came on Soft tracks at 1600m - untested at Ascot over this trip.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. No confirmed leaders; likely tactical with several on-pace types including #6 and #8 from good draws.

**Class**: BM66 level. Triple The Chant rises from CL1/Grad Hcp wins; Impressive Jewel steps up from metro 0MWLY win.

**Bias**: LOW confidence on bias data. Soft 5 with rain - inside barriers typically advantageous in wet conditions.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Impressive Jewel** qualifies via Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist) with EW EV of +25%. The 4yo mare is a proven wet-tracker (1 win, 3 places from 4 soft starts) with exceptional place consistency (64% career). Last start 1600m Ascot winner - proven at course and distance. Wide barrier (13) is the concern but she settles midfield and the 1600m gives time to position. At $13.00, the market is underrating her place credentials.

**Triple The Chant** is the clear class horse with 3 wins from 3 starts at 1600m on Soft tracks, but she's untested at Ascot over this distance. The $2.80 price offers no value with -10% edge. If backing, place only makes sense (76% place probability at $1.40 gives marginal +10% place EV).

## KEY RISKS

1. Impressive Jewel's wide barrier (13) in 13-runner field on wet track
2. Triple The Chant could dominate if she handles Ascot - class standout
