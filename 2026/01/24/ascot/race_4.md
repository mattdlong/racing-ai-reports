## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: All Grunt clocked 83.73s at this C/D winning in Feb 2025; competitive with Stylish Lord's 83.92s last start win.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected with no confirmed leaders; mid-race movers should benefit.
**Class**: BM72 field, most runners fit at grade; All Grunt stepping up from progressive wins.
**Bias**: No significant bias detected (LOW confidence); rail position not specified.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

All Grunt (#5) qualifies as Each-Way Value via Path A with EW EV of +8.2%. Strong place specialist score (1.84) with 75% career place rate from 8 starts. Single soft track start resulted in a win, and he's backing up from a solid trial placing. The 4yo gelding is progressive with 3 wins from 8 starts and his only 1400m start at Ascot resulted in a win (83.73s). Barrier 8 is workable.

## KEY RISKS

1. Stepping up in class from lower grade wins; untested at BM72 metro level
2. Wide barrier (8) in 10-horse field could see him three-wide without cover
