# Ascot R7 | 1200m BM72
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 12r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**VALUE: #2 DE GRANDHOMME @ $6.50 - 0.75u E/W**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |

| 3 | Manhattan Strip | 11.00 | 38.6 | 9% | -1% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: De Grandhomme clocked 69.8s at Ascot 1200m last start (fastest in field at C/D), 2pts superior.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected; on-pace runners favored with 3-4 early speed types.
**Class**: Rising from Grad Hcp to BM72, but has wins at this level; stable handles progression well.
**Bias**: Soft 5 track with rain - inside barriers slightly favored; De Grandhomme's gate 9 neutral.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

De Grandhomme presents the only genuine value in this field. Two back-to-back Ascot 1200m wins (10/01 and 17/12) demonstrate proven C/D form - the critical factor in WA sprints. While resuming favorite Bohemian Diamond has class, she's first-up over an unsuitable trip (1200m vs preferred 1300-1400m) at skinny odds ($3.40) representing -25% edge. De Grandhomme's 62% career place rate (8/13) makes him a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score: 1.83), qualifying for E/W value via Path A (odds >= $6, place prob 40%).

## KEY RISKS

1. Soft track query - only 1 start on soft (0-0-0) vs 5 wins on good
2. Wide barrier (9) if pace collapses and rail becomes advantaged

## MARKET FAVORITE ASSESSMENT

**#7 Bohemian Diamond @ $3.40** - Market overbet. First-up off 216 days, won trial by 0.03L (narrow). Only 1 career start at 1200m (2024). The $3.40 implies 29% win probability but true probability closer to 22% given layoff and trip concerns. UNDERLAY by 25%.

## EXPERT TIPS

Sources checked: 1 | Support: De Grandhomme 25%, Manhattan Strip 25%, Bohemian Diamond 25%, Return Of The Mach 25%

Limited expert consensus available; market confidence in Bohemian Diamond not backed by tipster volume.

## WET TRACK ANALYSIS

Track: Soft 5 with rain continuing

| Horse | Soft Record | Rating |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Bohemian Diamond | 2/3 (67%) | POSITIVE |
| Vomo Island | 2/8 (25%) | NEUTRAL |
| De Grandhomme | 0/1 (0%) | QUERY |
| Manhattan Strip | 1/12 (8%) | NEGATIVE |

Bohemian Diamond has the best wet form, but De Grandhomme's single soft run (6th at Belmont) was at wrong distance. His Ascot form trumps wet concerns.
