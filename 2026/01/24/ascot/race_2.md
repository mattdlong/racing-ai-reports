## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Place% | Edge | Tier |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|--------|------|------|
| 5 | London Rose | 18.00 | 80 | 8% | 30% | +44% | EW_VALUE |
| 1 | Boy Crush | 2.60 | 50 | 30% | 85% | -17% | VALUE |
| 7 | They'reallsisters | 3.00 | 50 | 25% | 72% | -22% | VALUE |
| 3 | Optimus Prime | 6.00 | 48 | 12% | 44% | -16% | WATCH |
| 2 | Sovereign Rock | 11.00 | 35 | 7% | 25% | -23% | WATCH |
| 6 | Kute As Kan Be | 19.00 | 32 | 5% | 18% | -5% | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Boy Crush best time figure (65.03s/1100m debut), but untested on soft going.
**Pace**: MODERATE - Boy Crush likely leads, They'reallsisters stalks, pace should be honest without being suicidal.
**Class**: Field largely maiden 2YOs stepping up from 1100m. Boy Crush and They'reallsisters clash for the 3rd time.
**Wet Track**: CRITICAL FACTOR - London Rose only runner with proven SOFT track placing (2nd Ascot Soft 5). Boy Crush, They'reallsisters, Optimus Prime all untested on soft.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

London Rose is the value play at $18. The filly has PROVEN soft track ability - placed 2nd on Soft 5 at Ascot (25/10/25) when beaten 2.54L. Fresh from a solid trial 2nd at Belmont (19/01/26). While Boy Crush beat They'reallsisters and Optimus Prime on debut, that was on Good ground. The step to Soft 5 introduces significant uncertainty for the favourites. London Rose's proven wet track form at the course gives her a clear edge in conditions. Wide barrier (9) is a negative but 1200m gives time to find position. At 7x the favourite's odds, she's the clear EW value play.

**EW Qualification**: Passes ALL THREE paths:
- Path A: $18 >= $6, EW EV 50.8% >= +5%, Place prob 30% >= 30%
- Path B: Specialist score 2.60 >= 1.3
- Path C: $18 >= $15, Place EV 57.5% >= +10%

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (9) - could get caught 3-4 wide without cover
2. 76 days since last race start (freshness query despite recent trial)
3. Rain could worsen track to Heavy, unknown form on Heavy

## MARKET WATCH

**Boy Crush ($2.60)**: Clear class leader on debut form but betting at prohibitive odds given soft track query. Fair odds ~$3.10. NO VALUE.

**They'reallsisters ($3.00)**: Runner-up to Boy Crush but also no soft track runs. If Boy Crush comes unstuck, she's the beneficiary but also blind on going. UNDERLAY.
