# Ascot R1 | 1000m CL1
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 9r | Soft 5

## ACTION

**VALUE: #2 WRITTEN WORDS @ $3.40 - 1.1u EW**

| 6 | Bambino Chino | 19.00 | 25.0 | 5% | - | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Written Words posted 58.06s winning here on 14/01 - quickest recent 1000m figure in field.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected; 3 on-pacers (Major Flirt, Watto's Mark, Call Me Frosty) should ensure genuine tempo.
**Class**: CL1 race, Written Words rising from maiden win - progressive profile suits.
**Bias**: Soft 5 track, no strong bias detected; Written Words has one soft-track place from 1 start.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Written Words (2) won impressively at this track and distance just 10 days ago, defeating today's rival Himizu by 1.2L in 58.06s. The Pateman/Carbery combination is reliable and the gelding draws barrier 7 which should allow a midfield run with cover. At $3.40 offering +8.8% edge, the EW bet captures value on both win (8.8% EV) and place (20% EV) components. The market has Call Me Frosty as favourite despite never winning a race (0/4) - that's an overreaction to consistent placings.

## KEY RISKS

1. First start on Soft 5 (untested on rain-affected) - all 4 starts on Good tracks
2. Outside barrier (7) may complicate in wet conditions if rail is favoured
