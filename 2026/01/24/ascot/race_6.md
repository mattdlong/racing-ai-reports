| 8 | Celestial Storm | 23.00 | 35.0 | 8% | -16% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Richanco has proven speed on soft ground (2/3 wins), consistent top-3 finisher with 71% place strike rate.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Richanco races on-pace and should get a soft lead or sit 2nd. No noted front-runners to pressure.

**Class**: All runners competitive at BM72 level. Heeza Phoenix stepping down from WA Guineas but first-up concern and wide barrier.

**Bias**: Track bias neutral (LOW confidence), Soft 5 condition suits Richanco's wet track record over favorite's unknown soft form.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Richanco rates the clear value play. The 5yo gelding brings a stellar 43% win rate and 71% place rate from 14 starts. Crucially, he has proven soft track credentials with 2 wins from 3 starts on rain-affected ground, whereas market favorite Heeza Phoenix has ZERO soft track starts in his career. Richanco won fresh at Lark Hill (17/11), ran 3rd in the Summer Scorcher (01/01), and now steps to his preferred 1200m distance where he has 3 wins from 6 starts. At $5.00, he represents 60% overlay to his assessed 32% win probability.

The favorite Heeza Phoenix ($2.50) is talented but has significant query marks: first-up off 62 days, wide barrier 10 in a 10-horse field, and untested on soft ground. His -30% underlay status means passing despite his unbeaten run.

## KEY RISKS

1. Richanco's last start 6th (10/01) when stepped to 1100m sprint - may lack acceleration
2. Barrier 7 not ideal but workable in 10-horse field
