Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 12r | Soft 5

Place Specialist qualifier (score 2.52) - excellent 53% career place rate on soft tracks.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Tier | Note |
|---|-------|------|------|--------|------|------|------|
| 4 | Amazing Cheat | $4.60 | 22% | 49% | +1% | WATCH | Last start winner |
| 2 | Sowar | $4.60 | 17% | 41% | -22% | PASS | Short price |
| 5 | Candlelight Supper | $11.00 | 10% | 26% | +10% | EW VALUE | Place specialist |
| 8 | Audio Boy | $10.00 | 9% | 25% | -10% | WATCH | Strong placer |
| 11 | Pony Up | $8.00 | 11% | 29% | -12% | WATCH | 3yo rising |
| 12 | Starwalker | $8.00 | 11% | 29% | -12% | WATCH | 2x 2200m winner |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Amazing Cheat set pace and won 2200m here 13 days ago in 138.82s; hard to beat on repeat.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - #4 likely leads, #5/#8 settling midfield with finishing kick.
**Class**: BM84 step up for most; #4 rising sharply but won BM66+ comfortably last two.
**Bias**: Neutral bias detected (LOW confidence); Soft 5 favors proven wet-trackers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Candlelight Supper qualifies as EW VALUE via Path B (Place Specialist). The 7yo mare has an exceptional 53% place rate at this course, with 3 wins and 10 places from 18 starts on soft ground. Second to Amazing Cheat last start over this C/D, beaten just 0.55L. At $11.00 with $3.20 place odds, the each-way value is marginal but the place specialist score of 2.52 indicates she consistently outperforms her win probability in placing.

Amazing Cheat ($4.60) is the obvious danger and likely winner but doesn't offer sufficient edge at current odds. Fair odds ~$4.55. The mare has won back-to-back and is well suited, but price reflects this.

## KEY RISKS

1. Amazing Cheat may simply be too good - won here 13 days ago and looks progressive
2. Soft 5 could deteriorate further; #5 handles soft but untested on heavy

## MARKET WATCH

- **#4 Amazing Cheat** $4.60: Fair price, genuine winning chance but no value
- **#8 Audio Boy** $10.00: Strong placer (48% career), watch for EW if drifts
