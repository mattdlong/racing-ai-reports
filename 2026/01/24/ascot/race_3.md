# Ascot R3 | 1100m BM66
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 10r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #5 AMARLIME @ $8.00 - 1.0u EW**

Path B qualifier (Place Specialist Score: 2.77). Long layoff concern but outstanding 83% place rate (10/12 career placings). Good draw (4), trainer Adam Durrant.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Place% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|--------|------|------|-------|
| 4 | Urquharts Bluff | $4.50 | 47.2 | 22% | 62% | -1% | VALUE | - |
| 5 | Amarlime | $8.00 | 47.6 | 12% | 38% | 0% | EW_VALUE | 1.0u |
| 1 | Ain't No Other Man | $4.50 | 39.5 | 22% | 59% | -1% | WATCH | - |
| 2 | Snippy Which | $5.50 | 37.0 | 18% | 51% | -1% | WATCH | - |
| 9 | Rommel's Goddess | $5.50 | 37.0 | 18% | 50% | -1% | WATCH | - |
| 6 | Cannykev | $6.50 | 35.0 | 15% | 44% | -3% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Urquharts Bluff (4) has the best recent form with a win at Ascot (1200m) 9 days ago in 70.98s. Rommel's Goddess (9) comes off back-to-back wins at lower levels.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No confirmed leaders; likely genuine tempo with runners finding cover. Mid-race moves should be viable.

**Class**: BM66 level. #4 Urquharts Bluff rising from CL1 win, #9 Rommel's Goddess rising from CL3 win at Bunbury, #11 Marines Cry also rising from CL1.

**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence. Soft 5 with rain - genuine wet track.

## WET TRACK ASSESSMENT

| # | Horse | Soft Record | Heavy Record | Wet Rating |
|---|-------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| 3 | Gift Of The Heart | 4/13 (31%) | 0/2 | STRONG |
| 1 | Ain't No Other Man | 1/12 (8%) | 0/1 | POOR |
| 2 | Snippy Which | 1/5 (20%) | 0/2 | OK |
| 4 | Urquharts Bluff | 0/2 (0%) | 0/1 | QUERY |
| 5 | Amarlime | 0/2 (0%) | 0/0 | QUERY |
| 6 | Cannykev | 0/0 (0%) | 0/0 | UNTESTED |
| 9 | Rommel's Goddess | 0/3 (0%) | 0/1 | POOR |

**Critical**: Soft 5 track significantly impacts analysis. Gift Of The Heart (#3) has best wet form (4 wins from 13 soft starts) but drawn wide (11) and $17 outsider.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Amarlime (#5)** qualifies via Path B (Place Specialist) with exceptional 83% career place rate (10 placings from 12 starts). The 197-day layoff is a concern, but recent trial showed competence (3rd at Lark Hill). Barrier 4 is ideal, and trainer Adam Durrant has Snippy Which (#2) also engaged, suggesting stable confidence. At $8.00, the each-way value is driven by place odds of $2.40 against a 38% place probability.

**Urquharts Bluff (#4)** is the form horse (won last start at Ascot) with outstanding 88% place consistency (7/8 career). However, limited wet track data (0/2 soft) creates uncertainty, and $4.50 offers no edge. WATCH only.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Wet track unknowns** - Top-rated runners (#4, #5, #9) have poor or untested soft track records
2. **Amarlime 197-day layoff** - First-up after extended break, only a trial to guide fitness
3. **Gift Of The Heart** (#3) could outperform at $17 with best wet credentials if track deteriorates further
