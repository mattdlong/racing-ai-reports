# Randwick R9 | 1200m BM78
Fri 24 Jan | 5:20pm | 12r | Soft 5 | Rain

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier | Notes |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|------|-------|
| 11 | Beside The Ocean | $4.00 | 25% | 0% | 60% | WATCH | Lightly raced, class query |
| 3 | Candlewick | $4.80 | 18% | -14% | 45% | WATCH | Strong placer, inside draw |
| 5 | Super Norwest | $6.00 | 14% | -16% | 34% | PASS | C/D winner, wet form query |
| 4 | Diddle Dumpling | $9.50 | 9% | -15% | 22% | PASS | Long spell, trials tidy |
| 10 | Heat Missile | $9.50 | 9% | -15% | 25% | PASS | Wide draw, class lift |
| 8 | Useapin | $10.00 | 8% | -20% | 23% | PASS | No Randwick form |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figures. SUPER NORWEST (5) posted 69.38s at Randwick 1200m Good on 27/12 - best recent figure. CANDLEWICK won soft-ground BM78 at Randwick 1100m in 63.46s (3/1/26).

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Multiple on-pacers (CANDLEWICK, EVERYONE'S A STAR, BE QUIET, BESIDE THE OCEAN) should ensure genuine speed. Midfield runners may struggle to find clear running.

**Class**: BM78 Saturday metro. BESIDE THE OCEAN (11) lightly raced with 50% win rate but untested at this class/distance combo. CANDLEWICK rising from BM72 win.

**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain. Track bias LOW confidence - neutral barriers, neutral styles. Inside draws (1-4) may benefit if rail deteriorates.

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

**Favorite: #11 BESIDE THE OCEAN @ $4.00**
- Implied: 25% | Assessed: 25% | Edge: 0% (FAIR)
- 3yo filly by Deep Impact x Beside The Sea (Waller)
- 4 starts: 2-1-1 (50% W, 75% P)
- Green light: Jason Collett booking, Waller stable
- Red flag: First run at 1200m, rising sharply in class

**Second Fav: #3 CANDLEWICK @ $4.80**
- Implied: 21% | Assessed: 18% | Edge: -14% (UNDERLAY)
- Strong Place Specialist Score: 1.88 (71% career place rate)
- Last run: 3rd Randwick 1100m BM78 Soft - 0.95L behind winner
- Inside barrier ideal but short of the class

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#5 SUPER NORWEST @ $6.00** - Best C/D form but untested on Soft 5 track at Randwick. Heavy track record: 0/6 wins, 2 places. Pass.

**#8 USEAPIN @ $10.00** - James McDonald booking eye-catching but 0 Randwick starts. Recent form patchy (9-3-4 last 3). Pass.

**#4 DIDDLE DUMPLING @ $9.50** - 181 days since racing but trials solid. 2/9 on Soft but no Heavy form. Nash Rawiller booking. Needs luck from barrier 5.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Track deterioration**: Rain forecast may push to Heavy range - BESIDE THE OCEAN has 1/1 Heavy record but sample tiny
2. **Pace collapse**: If leaders go slow, backmarkers (HELLBENT ON YOU, WINNING PROPOSAL) unlikely to make ground
3. **3yo weight-for-age**: BESIDE THE OCEAN (54.5kg) and STRADA VARENNA (52.5kg) get significant WFA advantage

## PLACE SPECIALIST WATCH

| Horse | Career Place% | Specialist Score | Place Odds |
|-------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| Beside The Ocean | 75% | 1.43 | $1.67 |
| Candlewick | 71% | 1.88 | $1.88 |
| Heat Missile | 57% | 1.36 | $2.88 |

CANDLEWICK qualifies as Strong Place Specialist but $1.88 place odds offer no value at 45% assessed probability (fair odds ~$2.22).

## VERDICT

Competitive BM78 with no clear value. BESIDE THE OCEAN is deserving favorite but $4.00 is fair price, not an overlay. Market correctly assessing the tight nature of this race.

**Suggested watch price**: BESIDE THE OCEAN $4.80+ for small play | CANDLEWICK E/W at $6.00+
