# Randwick R8 | 1400m BM100
Fri 24 Jan | 4:45pm | 11r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #2 NELLIE LEYLAX @ $11 - 1.5u EW**

Outstanding wet track record (6w/8p from 11 soft/heavy starts = 55% win rate). James McDonald booking. Barrier 1 ideal in rain-affected conditions. First-up after 140 days but trialled well.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figure holder; competitive field with similar recent ratings.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - Fire Star and Sandpaper likely to press, Cool Jakey midfield, Nellie Leylax can settle forward from barrier 1.
**Class**: BM100 metro, several runners rising from BM88 wins; Nellie Leylax has Open class form at higher level.
**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain forecast - inside runners and wet-trackers heavily advantaged.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#2 Nellie Leylax** is a genuine wet track specialist with elite soft/heavy credentials (55% win rate, 73% place rate on affected going). The barrier 1 draw is golden in these deteriorating conditions where inside runners historically dominate. James McDonald rides with purpose first-up, and the trial win at Beaumont (08/01) suggests ready to go. At $11, the market is underestimating her wet track superiority - fair odds around $6.50 based on 15% win probability.

**#4 War Eternal** offers secondary each-way value at same odds. Heavy track specialist (25% win rate on heavy) with barrier 3 and proven course/distance record (5 wins from 11 starts at 1400m). First-up query but Joshua Parr knows the horse well.

## KEY RISKS

1. First-up both selections (140+ days) - fitness query despite positive trials
2. Whinchat ($3.20 fav) has superior recent form if handles wide barrier (12) in wet
3. Cool Jakey proven at track/distance on soft and rising off BM88 win
