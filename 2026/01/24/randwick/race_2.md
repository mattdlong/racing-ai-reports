# Randwick R2 | 1600m BM78
Fri 24 Jan | 1:10pm | 14r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #11 RATHORAN @ $16 - 1.5u E/W**

Secondary: #1 Walking Painting @ $9 - 0.5u E/W (soft track specialist)

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Stake |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 11 | Rathoran | $16 | 80.0 | 11% | +76% | EW_VALUE | 1.5u E/W |
| 1 | Walking Painting | $9 | 42.1 | 12% | +8% | WATCH | 0.5u E/W |
| 6 | Zenmaster | $8 | 38.5 | 13% | +4% | WATCH | - |
| 7 | Artful Persuasion | $6.50 | 35.2 | 14% | -9% | PASS | - |
| 10 | Tenbury Wells | $7 | 34.8 | 12% | -16% | PASS | - |
| 9 | Kingston Charm | $8.50 | 33.5 | 10% | -7% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Open race with no standout figure. Walking Painting has best recent form on Soft.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Mid-field runners advantaged with wide barriers.
**Class**: BM78 metro, competitive field. Class rise for several.
**Bias**: Neutral (LOW confidence). Rain may create inside bias late.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Rathoran** qualifies as EW Value via Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist). Outstanding career place rate of 89% (16/18 runs in top 3), yielding a specialist score of 5.30. Recent form of 1-2 at provincial level suggests ready for metro. Wide barrier (13) is the concern but at $16, the place component offers significant value with EW EV of +59%.

Walking Painting (1: 7-10-24 career, soft track: 6w-7p from 14 starts) is the soft track specialist but wider barrier (10) and apprentice jockey (Siena Grima) are negatives.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rathoran first start at Randwick, untested at metro level
2. Wide barriers (11, 13) in large field if inside bias develops
3. Rain may deteriorate track further, favoring proven wet-trackers
