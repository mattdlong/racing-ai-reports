# Randwick R5 | 2000m BM88
Fri 24 Jan | 2:55pm | 9r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #1 TOWNSEND @ $11.00 - 1.0u EW**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 11 | Trapalanda | $2.60 | 49.3 | 28% | -27% | VALUE | - |
| 6 | Sounds Unusual | $3.00 | 45.2 | 18% | -46% | WATCH | - |
| 2 | Elliptical | $8.00 | 42.8 | 12% | -4% | WATCH | - |
| 1 | Townsend | $11.00 | 59.6 | 10% | +10% | EW_VALUE | 1.0u |
| 8 | Furious | $9.50 | 38.5 | 8% | -24% | PASS | - |
| 9 | Fay's Angels | $14.00 | 36.2 | 7% | -2% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Trapalanda has the best recent form figures with consistent 2nd placings at BM74-78 level in Victoria; stepping up to BM88 on rain-affected going is the query.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no clear leaders. Casino Bear (bar 2) and Fay's Angels (bar 3) likely to settle forward; Trapalanda and Sounds Unusual midfield.

**Class**: Townsend facing a significant class drop having raced at BM100 level; career place rate 69% suggests strong place specialist profile.

**Bias**: Soft 5 track with rain - no significant barrier bias detected; inside draws slightly favored.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Townsend (#1)** rates as EW VALUE at $11. Despite poor recent form (7-8-x-7), this is a strong place specialist (69% career place rate, specialist score 2.88) who has performed at BM100 level. The drop to BM88 provides class relief, and the inside barrier (1) suits on rain-affected ground. At double-figure odds with +10% edge on win and +8.5% on place, the EW value is clear.

The market favorite **Trapalanda (#11)** at $2.60 is overbet relative to true chances. While the form reads well (2-4-x-2-2-2), this is a Victorian campaigner stepping up in class (BM78 to BM88) and tackling Randwick for the first time. No value at the price.

## KEY RISKS

1. Townsend's form has been patchy - 7th last start at Wyong over 1600m
2. Wide barrier draws (9-10-11) disadvantaged if track deteriorates further
