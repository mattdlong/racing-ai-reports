# Randwick R1 | 1000m 2YO Maiden
Sat 24 Jan | 12:35pm | 11r | Soft 5

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Juvenile maiden with limited form; no edge identified at current prices

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 9 | Miss Scandal | $3.30 | 44.5 | 22% | -5% | WATCH | - |
| 11 | Sequinned | $5.00 | 42 | 16% | -10% | WATCH | - |
| 7 | Home And Dry | $6.00 | 40 | 15% | -10% | WATCH | - |
| 2 | Zambales | $6.50 | 39 | 14% | -9% | WATCH | - |
| 5 | Caloocan Beauty | $6.00 | 38 | 13% | -22% | WATCH | - |
| 10 | Satin Summer | $20.00 | 32 | 8% | -36% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No reliable speed figures - all runners have 0-2 starts; trial form only guide.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - Caloocan Beauty and Home And Dry likely to press, no confirmed leader.
**Class**: Metro 2yo maiden; trial-quality only distinguishes contenders.
**Bias**: Soft 5 track on inside, neutral bias (LOW confidence).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

This is a classic juvenile maiden with high uncertainty. **Miss Scandal** (9) is rightful favorite after consecutive 2nd/3rd placings behind Home And Dry in trials, but $3.30 implies 30% win probability which exceeds our 22% assessment. **Sequinned** (11) franked that form running 2nd to Home And Dry and offers slightly better value at $5.00, but barrier 9 is a negative.

**Home And Dry** (7) impressed winning her trial by 0.5L from barrier 2 and draws well again, but the Michael Freedman filly steps to 1000m first time. **Zambales** (2) is the "wildcard" - a well-bred half-brother to Tempted with strong trial work, but first starter and $6.50 doesn't compensate for the risk.

With data quality at MEDIUM and all runners essentially unraced, no selection meets our 75+ BEST_BET or 60+ STRONG_VALUE threshold. The market is efficient on the known form horses and overpricing the unknown debutants.

## KEY RISKS

1. 2yo form unreliable - trial times don't translate to race performance
2. Soft 5 track may suit/hinder different runners unpredictably
3. Wide barriers (9-11) for Sequinned/Miss Scandal/Oh Yes She Did problematic at 1000m

## MARKET WATCH

**If prices drift:**
- Sequinned > $6.50: borderline EW consideration
- Home And Dry > $8.00: worth another look

**Stable signals:**
- Waller has Miss Scandal and Sequinned - market split suggests no clear stable preference
- Freedman saddles Home And Dry and Satin Summer - likely stronger on former

## EXPERT CONSENSUS

| Horse | Sources | Support |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Miss Scandal | 1/1 | 100% |
| Sequinned | 1/1 | 100% |
| Home And Dry | 1/1 | 100% |
| Zambales | 1/1 | 100% |
