# Randwick R3 | 1200m BM81
Fri 24 Jan | 1:45pm | 16r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**VALUE: #17 ATHENA'S TREASURE @ $14 - 0.77u EW**

Secondary: #13 Nova Centauri @ $14 - 0.5u EW

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | EW EV | Tier |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|--------|-------|------|
| 17 | Athena's Treasure | 17 | $14 | 10% | +40% | 29% | +31.6% | VALUE |
| 13 | Nova Centauri | 14 | $14 | 9% | +26% | 27% | +20.4% | VALUE |
| 4 | Crusader Kings | 6 | $12 | 10% | +20% | 28% | +12.5% | VALUE |
| 10 | Kingdom Undersiege | 2 | $3.90 | 22% | -14% | 48% | - | WATCH |
| 5 | Joiselle | 10 | $10 | 9% | -10% | 32% | - | WATCH |
| 7 | Satin Stiletto | 16 | $5.50 | 15% | -18% | 35% | - | WATCH |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figure holder - open race with multiple chances on class.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected with several on-pace runners (#4, #10); suits stalkers.
**Class**: Rising horses #17 (60% SR) and #13 (43% SR, soft specialist) offer value.
**Bias**: Soft 5 track with rain - favors proven wet trackers. No significant barrier bias detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Athena's Treasure** presents outstanding each-way value at $14. The 4yo mare has a 60% win strike rate (3/5) and handles Good tracks well. While untested on Soft, her recent dominant win at Port Macquarie (1200m, 0.38L margin) and rapid rise through the grades suggests she's ready for this BM81 level. Wide barrier (17) is a concern but pace should be genuine enough for cover. At 29% place probability and +31.6% EW EV, she represents the best value proposition in the race.

**Nova Centauri** is the clear soft track specialist with 3 wins from 4 starts on soft/heavy going, including a CL3 win at Rosehill over 1400m. Stepping back to 1200m fresh from a break but the trainer (Rodney Northam) targets these Highway races effectively. At $14 with +26% edge and 86% career place rate, she's an excellent EW play.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Athena's Treasure**: Untested at Randwick and on Soft track - barrier 17 requires luck
2. **Nova Centauri**: 132 days since last start - fitness query first-up at metro level
3. **Field quality**: Large field (16r) increases volatility; favorite #10 is unexposed

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

The favorite Kingdom Undersiege ($3.90) shows -14% negative edge despite strong recent form (3 wins from 7 starts). The market has this horse right given rise to metro level. Value lies in the mid-range prices where the market has underestimated Nova Centauri and Athena's Treasure's soft track credentials and upside.
