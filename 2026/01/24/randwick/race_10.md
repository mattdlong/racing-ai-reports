## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Althoff's Wyong win (79.28s/1350m) suggests adequate speed, but field lacks standout figure.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. No confirmed leaders; likely tactical race suits on-pacers.

**Class**: BM78 metro. Althoff rising from provincial win; Puntin has 80% place rate but wide draw.

**Bias**: Soft 5 track. Althoff has 1/1 on heavy but 0/3 soft. Miss Spacegirl (3/6 soft) handles the give.

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

- **Favorite**: #2 Althoff @ $3.40 (implied 29.4%)
- **Market %**: 125.2% (standard metro overround)
- **Value detected**: None - all runners show negative edge

**Althoff** comes off a Wyong BM78 win but faces significantly stronger metro opposition. The 0/3 soft form is concerning on a Soft 5 track. Price is short given the form queries.

**Puntin** is the model's place specialist (80% place rate, score 1.85) but barrier 12 is a significant negative in an 11-horse field at 1400m. No value at $4.80.

**Miss Spacegirl** has the best soft track credentials (3/6) and won at this C/D last start, but fair odds suggest ~$9.00, not $7.50.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Track condition**: Several fancied runners have poor soft track records
2. **Wide barriers**: Puntin (12), Interjection (13), Miss Spacegirl (11) all face challenges
3. **Market efficiency**: 125% overround leaves minimal value opportunities

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

| # | Horse | Place Rate | Score | Classification |
|---|-------|------------|-------|----------------|
| 3 | Puntin | 80% | 1.85 | STRONG SPECIALIST |
| 4 | Captain Furai | 83% | 2.88 | STRONG SPECIALIST |
| 13 | Miss Spacegirl | 93% | 3.52 | STRONG SPECIALIST |

*Note: Place specialist scores indicate horses that place more often than expected, but current place odds offer no EV advantage.*
