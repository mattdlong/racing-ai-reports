# Randwick R4 | 1400m BM78
Fri 24 Jan | 2:20pm | 14r | Soft 5

## ACTION

**NO BET** - No positive edge detected across the field. Market appears efficient with the favorite (Cinsault $3.60) showing -20.8% edge. Best value detected in Sister Daae (+4% edge at $13) but win probability too low (8%) for conviction bet.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figure in the field. Cinsault has shown consistent form but lacks a dominant figure. Pretty Powerful won at 1400m on Good at BM72 level - yet to prove at BM78.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected with 4 on-pace types (Loving, Cinsault, Royal Corporal, She Within). Stalkers and midfield runners may benefit from the 14-runner field spreading the pace.

**Class**: BM78 metro level. Cinsault rising from BM72 win. Pretty Powerful also up from BM72 win. Loving rising sharply from Class 1-2 provincial wins - class rise a concern.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW. Soft 5 conditions favor proven wet trackers. Rail position not specified.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#5 CINSAULT ($3.60)** - Market favorite with exceptional place record (91% career placings). Tommy Berry booking is positive. Wide barrier (13) in 14-runner field is concern. Last start 4th at Randwick 1400m Soft - beaten 0.61L. Won 2 of last 5 but jumping 3 classes from lower grade. Place specialist score 1.97 but EW value insufficient at short odds.

**#1 PRETTY POWERFUL ($7.00)** - Best edge profile at -2% (closest to fair value). Chris Waller/Siena Grima combination. Inside barrier (1) advantageous. Won at 1400m BM72 last campaign. Career: 3 wins, 5 places from 8 starts (63% place rate). Soft track record: 1/4 wins - acceptable. Honest type that hits the frame consistently.

**#4 LOVING ($7.50)** - Progressive 3yo with 3 wins from 6 starts. No distance/course form - first time at Randwick 1400m. Last start 4th at Wyong 1300m beaten 0.05L in tight finish. Big class rise from provincial wins to BM78 metro. No wet track form recorded in profile - unknown factor on Soft 5.

**#8 BELLA CORAZON ($6.50)** - Strong place specialist (80% career placings). Won at Rosehill 1300m last December. Soft track record: 1/4 - proven on the going. However, edge calculation shows -22% underlay at current odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft 5 conditions** - Several key contenders (Loving, Cinsault) lack proven form on soft/heavy tracks
2. **Wide barriers** - Favorite Cinsault (13) and key contender Duvana (12) drawn wide in 14-runner field
3. **Class rise** - Multiple runners stepping up significantly (Loving from provincial, Cinsault from BM72)

## PLACE SPECIALIST ANALYSIS

| Horse | Place Rate | Specialist Score | Classification |
|-------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| Cinsault | 91% | 1.97 | STRONG SPECIALIST |
| Bella Corazon | 80% | 3.18 | STRONG SPECIALIST |
| Pretty Powerful | 63% | 2.14 | STRONG SPECIALIST |

## VERDICT

**PASS** - This is a competitive BM78 with no clear value. The market favorite Cinsault is overbet at $3.60 given the wide barrier and class rise. Pretty Powerful offers the best value profile but the edge is still negative. Sister Daae shows marginal positive edge (+4%) but at 8% win probability, this represents speculative value at best.

In a field where three horses show strong place specialist scores, an each-way approach would normally be considered, but EW EV calculations show negative expected value across all candidates due to the tight market.

**WATCH LIST**: Pretty Powerful if drifts to $8+ | Sister Daae if drifts to $15+
