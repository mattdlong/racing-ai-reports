## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Welcometotheshow recorded 95.91s at Flemington BM84 (1600m Good) - best recent figure in field, 3 straight wins.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected with Rolling Magic (bar 1) likely to lead; suits on-pace runners with late kick.
**Class**: Rising from BM84 win but 92% place rate (12/13) shows quality; Sun God drops from BM94.
**Bias**: Soft 5 track neutral bias; Welcometotheshow 1/2 soft, Jamberoo 2/10 soft specialist.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Welcometotheshow arrives in career-best form with 3 consecutive wins (BM70-BM78-BM84) and now tackles metro BM88 first-up in Sydney. The 4yo entire has an extraordinary 92% place rate (12 from 13 starts) showing exceptional consistency. Recent Flemington BM84 win (0.75L margin, 95.91s) is the best speed figure in this field. The $4.60 price significantly underrates this progressive type who handles soft ground (1/2 soft, 1/1 heavy). First-time Randwick is the only query but barrier 5 in an 8-horse field negates draw concerns.

## KEY RISKS

1. First start at Randwick - untested on track
2. Class rise to BM88 from BM84 win - steepest test to date

## MARKET OVERLAY NOTES

Sun God ($2.80 FAV) is short based on J McDonald booking and Waller stable, but 0/4 at Randwick and wide barrier (11) on rain-affected ground is concerning. The -16% underlay suggests false favourite status. Rolling Magic ($3.20) second-up after solid BM78 2nd but barrier 1 may see pushed forward; 22% win probability doesn't justify price.
