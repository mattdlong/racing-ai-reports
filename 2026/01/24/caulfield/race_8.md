## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Job Done has the best recent form with back-to-back wins at BM64/BM74 before a narrow 3rd at Geelong (63.49s for 1100m).
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected with no dominant leader; suits on-pace runners from midfield barriers.
**Class**: First metro Caulfield run but has won at BM74 level; Salty Pearl dropping from fillies stakes races.
**Bias**: Track bias data confidence LOW - neutral bias assumed.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Job Done presents the best value proposition in a competitive 3YO BM74. The gelding has won 3 of 5 starts with an 80% place strike rate, demonstrating remarkable consistency. His last-start 3rd at Geelong (beaten 0.46L) came against older horses and he was closing hard. The Price/Kent stable have this horse thriving and barrier 8 is workable in a moderate tempo. At $6.50, the market underrates his each-way credentials given the 46% calculated place probability.

## KEY RISKS

1. First run at Caulfield 1200m (0/0 C&D) - untested at track/trip combo
2. Step up from provincial BM74 to metro level - slight query on class
