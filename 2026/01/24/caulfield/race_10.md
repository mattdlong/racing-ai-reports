Fri 24 Jan | 4:25pm | 9r | Good 4

Secondary: #6 Narbold @ $10 - 1.0u E/W

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Black Storm | $19 | 83.0 | 8% | +52% | EW_VALUE | 1.5% |
| 6 | Narbold | $10 | 70.8 | 12% | +20% | EW_VALUE | 1.5% |
| 5 | Touchdown | $2.25 | 46.2 | 35% | -21% | WATCH | - |
| 12 | Yes I Know | $3.10 | 52.0 | 25% | -22% | WATCH | - |
| 8 | Ahha Ahha | $4.50 | 45.0 | 18% | -19% | WATCH | - |
| 10 | Enchanted Jenni | $26 | 38.0 | 5% | +30% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Touchdown has the best recent figures with impressive margins; Black Storm consistent but one-paced.
**Pace**: MODERATE - no obvious leader, likely to bunch midrace suits on-pace types.
**Class**: Black Storm rising sharply (country cups to metro BM84) but has metro form; Narbold placed in BM88.
**Bias**: Neutral - no significant track bias detected (LOW confidence).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Black Storm qualifies via all three EW paths at $19. Career place rate of 76% (13/17) makes him an elite place specialist (score 3.96). Last start trial win indicates freshness. Has won at this distance (2/9) and trainer Tim Fitzsimmons in good form. The wide barrier (5 from 9) is manageable in this field. At 47 days since last race, the trial suggests ready.

Narbold offers EW value at $10 with 71% career place rate. Chris Waller-trained, placed at BM88 level at Randwick. First VIC run but travelled well in NSW. Inside barrier (3) advantageous.

## KEY RISKS

1. Black Storm: Class rise from country to metro BM84 - unproven at this level
2. Narbold: First Victorian start, last run disappointing (11th at Flemington)

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

- Touchdown dominant favourite at $2.25 but NO VALUE (fair odds $2.86)
- Yes I Know progressive but short at $3.10 (fair odds $4.00)
- Black Storm and Narbold both overlay the market

## PLACE SPECIALIST ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Career | Place% | Specialist |
|---|-------|--------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Black Storm | 17: 5-8-0 | 76% | 3.96 |
| 6 | Narbold | 17: 2-10-0 | 71% | 2.47 |
| 12 | Yes I Know | 7: 2-4-0 | 86% | 2.15 |
| 5 | Touchdown | 6: 4-2-0 | 100% | 1.43 |
