# Caulfield R5 | 1100m BM70
Fri 24 Jan | 1:25pm | 10r | Good 4

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #1 SALSA FELLOW @ $8.00 - 1.0u EW**

Strong place specialist (1.79 score) with 60% career place rate. Qualifies via Path A (overlay) and Path B (specialist).

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | EW EV | Tier |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|-------|------|
| 1 | Salsa Fellow | $8.00 | 14% | +12% | 40% | +10.5% | EW VALUE |
| 2 | Along The River | $9.50 | 12% | +14% | 33% | +7.9% | VALUE |
| 9 | La Astro Chat | $11.00 | 10% | +10% | 30% | +7.0% | VALUE |
| 4 | Declared | $3.70 | 22% | -19% | 58% | - | UNDERLAY |
| 10 | Expulsion | $3.90 | 20% | -22% | 53% | - | UNDERLAY |
| 6 | Eagle Express | $7.50 | 13% | -3% | 38% | -1.5% | WATCH |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Declared (82) and Along The River (80) have the best recent figures; Salsa Fellow (78) sits just below.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - Declared and Salsa Fellow likely to press from good draws (bars 2-3).
**Class**: All runners at similar BM70 level. Declared won at Murray Bridge (provincial), now stepping to metro.
**Bias**: Neutral - no significant track bias detected at Caulfield Good 4.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Salsa Fellow offers the best each-way value in the race. The 4yo gelding boasts an outstanding 60% place strike rate (9 places from 15 starts) and was runner-up at Flemington BM70 last start behind Along The River. Good draw (bar 2) suits his on-pace racing pattern. At $8.00 with +10.5% EW EV and a specialist score of 1.79, he qualifies as an EW play via both Path A (value overlay) and Path B (place specialist).

## KEY RISKS

1. Metro Caulfield is different to country/Flemington - only 1 Caulfield start (unplaced)
2. Eagle Express (Waller/Melham) is a strong first-up performer resuming off 125 days

## MARKET ANALYSIS

- Market fav Declared ($3.70) appears short given provincial form and first Caulfield start
- Expulsion ($3.90) also looks an underlay with -22% edge despite strong recent form
- Value sits with each-way plays Salsa Fellow and Along The River at mid-range prices
