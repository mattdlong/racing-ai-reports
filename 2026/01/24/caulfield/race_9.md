## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | EW EV | Tier |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|-------|------|
| 3 | Regal Zeus | $11.00 | 12% | +32% | 34% | +25% | EW VALUE |
| 2 | Zou Sensation | $2.50 | 32% | -20% | 65% | -12% | UNDERLAY |
| 4 | Cafe Millenium | $7.50 | 14% | +5% | 36% | 0% | MARGINAL |
| 7 | Aztec Ruler | $6.00 | 15% | -10% | 41% | -5% | WATCH |
| 11 | Justadeel | $8.50 | 11% | -7% | 34% | -5% | WATCH |
| 1 | Attrition | $18.00 | 6% | +8% | 19% | -2% | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Zou Sensation best recent figures (82.29s 1400m Flemington win), Regal Zeus slower but consistent.
**Pace**: MODERATE - limited early speed, expect Zou Sensation to dictate; suits on-pace runners.
**Class**: BM100 level; Regal Zeus won Listed (LRD STKS) last start - dropping in class.
**Bias**: No significant bias detected (LOW confidence), neutral conditions favor best horse.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Regal Zeus steps down from a Listed win at Sandown (26/12) where he beat a quality field by 0.75L. The drop back to BM100 at his pet distance of 1400-1600m represents a clear class edge. While Zou Sensation is the obvious favorite with strong 1400m Caulfield form (3 wins from 5 starts), the market has him far too short at $2.50. Regal Zeus draws barrier 1, saves ground, and at $11 offers genuine each-way value with +32% win edge and +25% EW EV.

**Qualifies via**:
- Path A (Value Overlay): Odds $11 >= $6, EW EV +25% >= +5%, Place prob 34% >= 30%
- Path B (Place Specialist): Odds $11 >= $8, Specialist score 1.74 >= 1.3

## KEY RISKS

1. First run at Caulfield since 31/05/25 (8 months) - track form 2 wins from 7 starts
2. Rail barrier can be tricky if pace collapses - will need luck in running

## MARKET WATCH

- Zou Sensation: Clear underlay at $2.50 (fair odds ~$3.12)
- Cafe Millenium: Monitor for drift - 90 days since racing, wide barrier
- Justadeel: Strong place specialist (73% career) but lacks class for this grade
