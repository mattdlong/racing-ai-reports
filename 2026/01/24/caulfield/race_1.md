| 7 | Slane | 41.00 | 18 | 2% | -18% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Taken has the superior form (5 wins from 11, 91% place rate) but stepping up to 1700m untested.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no obvious leader; Taramansour and Verdad typically race on-pace.
**Class**: BM84 suits most runners; Taken rising from BM84 win, Merrigold fresh off Flemington victory.
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected on Good 4; inside barriers hold slight advantage in small field.

## FIELD ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Form | Placings | Going | C/D | Notes |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|----------|-------|-----|-------|
| 5 | Taken | 5 | 2.20 | 1-1-1-x-1 | 10/11 (91%) | Good 3/7 | 1/2 | Class horse, untested 1700m |
| 6 | Merrigold | 4 | 3.20 | 5-8-4-3-1 | 14/28 (50%) | Good 6/20 | 1/3 | Won Flemington 6 days ago |

| 3 | Verdad | 6 | 6.50 | 3-7-2-5-7 | 15/24 (63%) | Good 3/20 | 0/3 | Place specialist (1.88 score) |

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Taken (#5)** is the clear class horse with an exceptional 91% place rate and progressive profile. However, the $2.20 price implies 45% win probability while form analysis suggests ~37% - creating a -19% negative edge. The 1700m is an untested distance and the price offers no margin for error.

**Merrigold (#6)** comes in fresh off a dominant 2L Flemington win 6 days ago but faces a quick backup and class rise. The $3.20 price is similarly short of fair value (~$4.50).

**Verdad (#3)** and **Smokin' Princess (#2)** are both strong place specialists (63% and 61% career place rates) but neither offers EW value at $6.50 with 1/4 odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. Taken untested at 1700m - all wins at 1400-1620m
2. Merrigold backing up after 6 days - fitness query at longer trip

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

| Horse | Career Place Rate | Specialist Score | Classification |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Verdad | 63% | 1.88 | STRONG SPECIALIST |
| Smokin' Princess | 61% | 1.82 | STRONG SPECIALIST |
