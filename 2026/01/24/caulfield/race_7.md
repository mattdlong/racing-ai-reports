# Caulfield R7 | 1000m BM100
Fri 24 Jan | 2:35pm | 8r | Good 4

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #3 MIDWEST @ $11.00 - 1.25u EW**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 3 | Midwest | $11.00 | 58.1 | 10% | +10% | EW_VALUE | 1.25u |
| 2 | Way To The Stars | $9.50 | 41.4 | 12% | +14% | VALUE | 1.5u |
| 7 | Beast Mode | $3.40 | 45.6 | 26% | -12% | WATCH | - |
| 4 | Oak Hill | $3.50 | 39.5 | 22% | -23% | WATCH | - |
| 6 | Geegees Mistruth | $3.60 | 38.0 | 21% | -24% | WATCH | - |
| 1 | Insurrection | $13.00 | 33.4 | 9% | +17% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Beast Mode ran 56.55s at MV (1000m Good) winning by 1.5L - best recent figure in field.
**Pace**: FAST expected with multiple on-pace types (Way To The Stars, Oak Hill, Beast Mode) - suits off-pace runners.
**Class**: BM100 metro - Midwest has proven at this level with 8 distance wins from 23 starts.
**Bias**: Neutral (low confidence) - no significant style or barrier bias detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Midwest** qualifies as Each-Way Value via TWO paths: (A) Value Overlay with 10.1% EW EV and 31% place probability, and (B) Place Specialist with exceptional 3.04 specialist score (73% career place rate). Fresh from solid trial 2nd at Sandown (2.5L behind winner), the Freedman-trained 7yo has outstanding consistency at this distance (8 wins, 24 placings from 33 starts). With multiple speed horses set to compete for the lead, the anticipated hot pace should set up perfectly for this stalker who can pounce late. First-up after 139 days is a concern, but trial form suggests readiness.

## KEY RISKS

1. First-up off 139-day break - fitness untested in race conditions
2. Wide barrier (4 of 8) in small field may get shuffled back

## MARKET ANALYSIS

The three market leaders (Beast Mode $3.40, Oak Hill $3.50, Geegees Mistruth $3.60) are all showing as UNDERLAYS at current odds. Market overbet on short-priced runners creates value in the mid-range. Midwest's $11.00 offers genuine overlay given proven BM100 form and exceptional place consistency.
