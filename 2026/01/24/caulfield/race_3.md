# Caulfield R3 | 1000m 2YO Fillies
Fri 24 Jan | 12:20pm | 12r | Good 4

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Debutant-heavy field with insufficient form to assess. Heavy favorite Angels Fury ($2.50) has trials only - too much uncertainty for confident position.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 6 | Angels Fury | 2.50 | 37.2 | 32% | -20% | WATCH | - |
| 10 | Jadzia | 4.60 | 39.3 | 18% | -17% | WATCH | - |
| 1 | Streisand | 7.00 | 35.0 | 12% | -16% | WATCH | - |
| 3 | Ghana's Akan | 8.00 | 33.0 | 10% | -20% | WATCH | - |
| 5 | Gin Twist | 21.00 | 28.0 | 5% | -5% | PASS | - |
| 2 | Lady Of Five | 26.00 | 25.0 | 4% | -4% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No reliable speed figures available - only 4 runners have race experience at this distance, with no sectional data in briefing.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - #6 Angels Fury and #10 Jadzia both showed good early speed in trials, should contest lead.
**Class**: First-starters dominate - 8 of 12 runners are debutants with only jump-out form to assess.
**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - neutral conditions expected on Good 4 rail.

## FIELD BREAKDOWN

**Raced Runners (4):**
- #1 Streisand (2:0-2-0): Two runner-up finishes at Flemington 1000m, 76 days between runs - query freshness
- #2 Lady Of Five (2:1-1-0): Won Eagle Farm debut, 2nd Doomben - but 90 days off, trialled only
- #3 Ghana's Akan (1:0-1-0): 2nd Geelong 1100m debut, drops in distance, Ciaron Maher yard
- #5 Gin Twist (1:0-0-1): 3rd Pakenham debut 14 days ago (beaten 0.06L) - quick back, Hayes yard

**Key Debutants:**
- #6 Angels Fury: $2.50 FAV - Ciaron Maher, two trial wins, Ben Melham retains
- #10 Jadzia: $4.60 - Won Sandown trial impressively, Grahame Begg/Jordan Childs
- #11 La Gitana: $15 - Two trial wins, Hayes yard, Luke Currie
- #13 Queen's English: $14 - Freedman yard, two trial wins, inside draw

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Cannot identify positive edge in this field. The favorite Angels Fury shows promise but $2.50 implies 40% win probability for a debutant in a 12-horse field with no race experience - this is not value. The best raced runner (Jadzia) also only has trial form and is short at $4.60.

The four experienced runners (Streisand, Lady Of Five, Ghana's Akan, Gin Twist) all have question marks:
- Streisand: Wide draw (11), long absence
- Lady Of Five: Long absence (90d), wide draw (9)
- Ghana's Akan: Wide draw (12), stepping up in class
- Gin Twist: Only 3rd on debut, quick backup

## KEY RISKS

1. Debutant-heavy field makes form assessment unreliable
2. Favorite is untested under race pressure - trials ≠ races
3. Wide draws (barriers 9-14) may disadvantage half the field in a sprint
