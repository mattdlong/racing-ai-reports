**Scratched**: #10 Bons To Riches, #12 Heavenly Eagle, #15 Two Wolves

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Paradise City ran 2nd at Flemington over 1400m in 82.2s (BM74) - best recent figure. Everain and Conchiero have talent but resuming from lengthy breaks (177 and 258 days respectively).

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - several on-pace types (Le Ferrari, Quiseen from barrier 1) should ensure genuine speed without overly contested tempo. Mid-field runners may benefit.

**Class**: Even BM70 field. Conchiero (Waterhouse/Bott) and Everain (Freedman) dropping from higher grades but both resuming cold. Paradise City tested at BM78 level with good efforts.

**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence. Good 4 surface typically neutral at Caulfield 1400m.

## CONTENDER NOTES

**#8 Paradise City ($4.50)** - Market favourite. 2nd at Flemington BM74 last start behind Georgie Get Mad (who also runs here). Has 4 starts at Caulfield without a win (best 2nd). Wide barrier 11 a concern. Peter Moody-trained mare with 5 wins from 22 starts. Score: 39.6

**#13 Everain ($5.00)** - Resuming from 177-day break for Freedman stable. Won 2 from 5 with excellent trial form. Good barrier 2. Untested at track but won fresh at Mornington. Question marks over fitness first-up at metro level. Score: 36.8

**#11 Conchiero ($5.50)** - 258 days since racing. Waterhouse/Bott galloper with 2 wins from 7. Won at 1400m Warwick Farm as maiden. Trialled well but very wide barrier 13 and big class test first-up at Caulfield metro. Score: 35.5

**#1 Le Ferrari ($8.50)** - Honest galloper with 6 wins from 34 starts. Excellent distance record (5/24 at 1400m). Ran 2nd at Geelong BM70 last start. Has won at this track. Solid good track record (5/23). Slight value at $8.50. Score: 35.7

**#9 Quiseen ($9.00)** - Inside barrier 1 ideal. Mare with 4 wins from 11 starts (36% win rate). Untested at 1400m. Ran 2nd at Caulfield 1200m last start. Distance query is key risk. Score: 33.7

## KEY RISKS

1. **Market Efficiency**: No significant value detected - market appears well-priced
2. **Resumers**: Three key contenders (Everain, Conchiero, Shoeless) resuming from extended breaks with fitness unknowns
3. **Wide Barriers**: Several fancied runners drawn wide (Paradise City 11, Conchiero 13)

## MARKET WATCH

Le Ferrari at $8.50 offers marginal value (+2% edge) given consistent form and strong distance record, but insufficient for recommended bet. Monitor for any drift beyond $10.
