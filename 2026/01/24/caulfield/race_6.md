# Caulfield R6 | 2000m BM84
Fri 24 Jan | 2:00pm | 9r | Good 4

## ACTION

**EACH-WAY VALUE: #3 PARADISE STORM @ $11.00 - 1.5u EW**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 6 | Suntora | $3.10 | 52 | 28% | -13% | WATCH | - |

| 3 | Paradise Storm | $11.00 | 82 | 11% | +21% | EW VALUE | 1.5u |
| 1 | Dublin Journal | $15.00 | 55 | 8% | +20% | VALUE | 0.5u |
| 10 | Midnight Glow | $16.00 | 38 | 6% | -4% | PASS | - |
| 2 | Night Endeavor | $34.00 | 32 | 5% | +70% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Suntora shows best recent figures with dominant BM66 win (4.25L) stepping up to BM84; Steel Run has quality figures but 286 days off.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected with limited genuine speed; Opening Address and Active Duty likely to contest early before settling to steady tempo.
**Class**: Paradise Storm rising from BM78 wins to BM84 metro - manageable rise with form suggesting progression; Suntora rising sharply from BM66.
**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence); true rail position suits all barriers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Paradise Storm** (EW Value - Path A & B) qualifies via dual pathways: (1) Value Overlay at $11 with 21% EW EV and 35% place probability, and (2) Place Specialist with exceptional 83% career place rate (20/24). The 5yo has won 2 of last 5 starts including a dominant 1.75L win at Sandown (BM78, 2400m) and followed with a solid 4th in the Woodford Cup (1700m) against similar class. First time at Caulfield is a query, but strong distance record (13 starts, 2 wins, 83% place rate over 2000m+). Michael Dee booking is positive.

## KEY RISKS

1. First start at Caulfield - untested on this tight track configuration
2. Class rise from country/provincial BM78 to metro BM84

## MARKET WATCH

- **Suntora** ($3.10): Dominant recent form but sharply rising in class from BM66. Market has her too short given the grade jump - 3 classes in 2 months is aggressive.
- **Steel Run** ($4.40): Quality profile with 57% place rate but 286 days off. First-up query at this trip despite strong trials. Market price reflects risk.

## PLACE SPECIALIST ANALYSIS

| Horse | Place Rate | Expected | Specialist Score | Rating |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Paradise Storm | 83.3% | 26.4% | 3.15 | STRONG |
| Active Duty | 81.0% | 28.8% | 2.81 | STRONG |
| Night Endeavor | 60.0% | 26.4% | 2.27 | MODERATE |
