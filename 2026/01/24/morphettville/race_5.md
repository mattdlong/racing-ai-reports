| 2 | Elite Thunder | $16.00 | 22.0 | 5% | -20% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited time data available; It's Gnarly showed fast 58.52s trial win (1000m Caulfield) suggesting natural speed.

**Pace**: MODERATE - Several first-starters with unknown pace styles; likely even tempo with no obvious leader.

**Class**: Weak CL1 field with 4 debutants (Gnarly, Uptown Monk, Yarrawizardharry debut, Second Heaven); experienced runners are maidens (Discreetly Blue 0/10, Elite Thunder 0/3).

**Bias**: Neutral - low confidence on track bias data.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#3 It's Gnarly ($4.00 FAV)** - WATCH
- Debut after impressive trial form (won 1000m Caulfield 2.5L, 58.52s)
- Well-regarded Victorian trial form; Logan McGill trainer
- RED FLAGS: Wide barrier (10), untested at 1200m, debut uncertainty
- GREEN LIGHTS: Strong trial times, professional prep

**#1 Discreetly Blue ($5.00)** - WATCH
- Most experienced runner (10 starts, 0 wins, 6 places - 60% place rate)
- PLACE SPECIALIST: Score 1.39 (places at 1.4x expected rate)
- Recent form: 2-2-2-5-x-3 (consistent placer, can't win)
- RED FLAGS: 0 wins from 10 starts, hasn't won
- GREEN LIGHTS: Consistency, Good track form (8:0-4)

**#9 Prestige Ka Ying ($4.80)** - WATCH
- Victorian filly, 4 starts (0-3 places, 75% place rate)
- STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST: Score 1.95
- Recent 2nd Cranbourne (1200m, 72.14s) - solid effort
- RED FLAGS: First time at Morphettville, class 1 rise
- GREEN LIGHTS: High place consistency, good draw (3)

**#4 Uptown Monk ($4.20)** - PASS
- Will Clarken debutant from barrier 1
- Won barrier trial (900m) on 15/01/26
- RED FLAGS: Untested, limited trial form
- GREEN LIGHTS: Inside draw, well-bred stable

## EACH-WAY ASSESSMENT

| # | Horse | Odds | Place% | EW EV | Specialist | Rating |
|---|-------|------|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Discreetly Blue | $5.00 | 49.2% | -5.8% | 1.39 | NO VALUE |
| 9 | Prestige Ka Ying | $4.80 | 45.9% | -16.8% | 1.95 | NO VALUE |
| 3 | It's Gnarly | $4.00 | 55.8% | -7.2% | N/A | NO VALUE |

Despite strong place specialist scores for Discreetly Blue (1.39) and Prestige Ka Ying (1.95), the place odds do not offer value at current prices.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Debutant-heavy field** - 4 first-starters create unpredictable race dynamics
2. **No proven winner** - Every runner is a maiden; no reliable form reference
3. **Weather** - Rain forecast may affect track conditions

## MARKET NOTES

- Market percentage: 125.8% (standard for SA country metro)
- Four-way market: Gnarly $4.00, Uptown Monk $4.20, Yarrawizardharry $4.40, Prestige Ka Ying $4.80
- Discreetly Blue drifting to $5.00 despite place consistency

## PASS RATIONALE

This is an unpredictable maiden/Class 1 race with:
- No runner showing positive edge vs market prices
- Multiple debutants with unknown ability
- Experienced runners who have proven they can't win
- Insufficient data quality for confident probability assessment

The market has priced the top 4-5 runners efficiently. Without a clear edge, the recommended action is **PASS**.
