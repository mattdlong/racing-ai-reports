## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Mrs Penny Cracker (1-2-2-1) best recent pattern; Flaming Eyes (1-1-4-2-3) back-to-back wins before tougher test.

**Class**: Mrs Penny Cracker rising from 0-62 to BM66 after Gawler win (105.4s/1707m). Flaming Eyes also rising post-CL2 win. Both face step up.

**Distance**: Flaming Eyes proven at 1600m (2 wins from 5), Mrs Penny Cracker 0/4 at the trip but won over 1707m.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Mrs Penny Cracker and Dougal Mckeen likely to press. Midfield runners get decent track position.

- First metro assignment - class query

## SELECTION RATIONALE

This is a competitive BM66 with no clear value. Mrs Penny Cracker is the logical favourite with best recent form but the $2.90 offers no edge given wide barrier and distance uncertainty. Flaming Eyes at $6.00 represents the closest to value with +8% edge on my assessment, but confidence is insufficient for a bet given the class rise and lack of expert validation.

Chur Nibble's place consistency (78%) is notable but was comprehensively beaten by Mrs Penny Cracker last start in an easier race.

## KEY RISKS

1. Mrs Penny Cracker's wide barrier (9) could prove costly if pace is slow
2. Flaming Eyes stepping up in class after winning weaker company
3. Rain forecast may shift track conditions during meeting

## PLACE SPECIALIST NOTE

Flaming Eyes qualifies as a **PLACE SPECIALIST** (score 1.39) with 60% actual place rate vs 43% expected. If odds drift to $7+, the each-way becomes marginal value via Path A.
