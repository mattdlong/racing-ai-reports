# Morphettville R7 | 1100m BM100
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 6r | Good 4

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #7 WIGGUM @ $12.00 - 1.5u E/W**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Klabel | $2.45 | 30% | -26% | 85% | WATCH |
| 3 | Sghirripa | $5.00 | 18% | -10% | 56% | WATCH |
| 5 | Sir Now | $3.90 | 15% | -42% | 49% | PASS |
| 6 | Great Maximus | $8.00 | 12% | -4% | 39% | WATCH |
| 7 | Wiggum | $12.00 | 10% | +20% | 33% | VALUE |
| 9 | Lingani | $6.50 | 15% | -3% | 48% | WATCH |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Klabel has the best recent figures (88) coming off a course win at Morphettville last start. Sghirripa and Lingani both have strong C/D records but returning from breaks.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Klabel (bar 1) and Lingani (bar 3) likely to press forward. Wiggum can settle midfield from bar 6 and finish over the top if pace is genuine.

**Class**: BM100 level suits most runners. Wiggum won at BM78 two starts back and placed in this grade at Ballarat. Not out of his depth.

**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Rain forecast may impact track during meeting.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Wiggum represents the only genuine value play in this small field at $12. The market heavily favors Klabel ($2.45) but the favorite has 0 wins from 6 starts at 1100m and his recent form shows vulnerability (9th at Cranbourne, 5th at Flemington). Wiggum has strong place consistency (50% career) making him a solid each-way proposition via Path A: Odds $12 >= $6, EW EV +21.9% >= +5%, Place prob 33% >= 30%. The specialist score of 1.79 confirms place value.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (6) in small field if pace collapses
2. Recent form dip (6th Ballarat BM100) though won well prior
