# Morphettville R1 | 1050m 2YO Maiden
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 3r | Good 4 (Rain)

## ACTION

**NO BET - Unratable 2YO debutants in tiny field**

This race presents insurmountable analysis challenges:
1. Only 3 runners after scratchings (50% scratched)
2. All runners are debutants with zero race starts
3. No speed figures available - only trial/jumpout form
4. Minimal edge opportunity in short-priced 3-horse field
5. Data quality: MEDIUM with significant gaps

## FIELD SUMMARY

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Trainer | Trial Form | Status |
|---|-------|-----|------|---------|------------|--------|
| 2 | Big Wigs | 6 | $2.80 | P Stokes | 2nd Sandown 900m trial | Active |
| 4 | Ole Go | 5 | $2.90 | M Hickmott | 1st Murray Bridge 800m trial | Active |
| 5 | Expensive Taste | 3 | $2.25 | T&C McEvoy | 1st x2 jumpouts | Active (FAV) |

**Scratched**: #1 Our Brave Boy, #3 Lalor, #6 She's Iconnic

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Est Win% | Edge | Fair Odds | Rating |
|---|-------|------|----------|------|-----------|--------|
| 5 | Expensive Taste | $2.25 | ~40% | -10.0% | $2.50 | UNDERLAY |
| 2 | Big Wigs | $2.80 | ~32% | -10.4% | $3.12 | UNDERLAY |
| 4 | Ole Go | $2.90 | ~35% | +1.5% | $2.86 | FAIR |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No race speed figures available - all debutants with only trial form.
**Pace**: Impossible to assess with no racing history; likely moderate given small field.
**Class**: Provincial 2YO maiden ($8,100 prize), lowest rung on class ladder.
**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW; neutral assumed.

## RUNNER PROFILES

**#5 EXPENSIVE TASTE (FAV $2.25)**
- 2yo filly by top SA stable Tony & Calvin McEvoy
- Two jumpout wins (800m) suggest natural ability
- Best barrier (3) in small field
- Jockey: Rochelle Milnes (apprentice)
- **Risk**: Debutant premium priced in; no proven race form

**#4 OLE GO ($2.90)**
- 2yo colt trained by Michael Hickmott
- Won 800m trial at Murray Bridge by 2.14L (dominant margin)
- Trial time 48.85s suggests decent raw speed
- Jockey: Todd Pannell (experienced)
- **Edge**: Only runner showing marginal value (+1.5%)

**#2 BIG WIGS ($2.80)**
- 2yo colt from Phillip Stokes stable
- 2nd in Sandown 900m trial (0.25L margin)
- Widest barrier (6) but irrelevant in 3-horse field
- Jockey: Jacob Opperman (apprentice)
- **Risk**: Outside draw and beaten in trial

## KEY RISKS

1. **Unratable field**: Zero race starts across all runners; trial form unreliable predictor
2. **Tiny field dynamics**: 3-horse races often produce unpredictable results
3. **Short prices, no edge**: All runners priced under $3 with minimal/no value
4. **Weather**: Rain affecting Good 4 track - may deteriorate

## CONCLUSION

This is a **PASS** race. Without race form to generate speed figures, meaningful probability estimates are speculative. The market has likely absorbed all available trial information. The only marginal value (Ole Go +1.5%) falls well below the threshold for action.

**Recommendation**: Wait for these horses to debut and establish race form before betting.
