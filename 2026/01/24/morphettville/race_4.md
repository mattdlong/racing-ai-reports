## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Teardrop Rotation has best recent form winning at Flemington BM84 (95.91s/1600m), class above this. Komachi won at Morphettville 1800m BM76 in 111.47s on 27/12/25.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - Teardrop Rotation and I Catchem Fox likely to press, Komachi and Bamyan Buddha can sit midfield and finish. 8-runner field reduces pressure.

**Class**: BM72 is drop for several. Teardrop Rotation dropping from BM84 (clear class edge). Komachi dropping from BM76/78 level. Bamyan Buddha at level after BM72 win.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - no strong directional bias detected. Rail position not specified. Good 4 should suit most.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Komachi (#5)** - Strong place specialist (1.42 score) with 55% career place rate. Won at Morphettville 1600m (Nov 22) and 1800m (Dec 27). C/D record of 3 wins from 8 starts at course, 4 wins from 10 at distance. Will Clarken stable in form. At $7.00 offers +12% edge with 44% place probability. EW EV of +11%.

**Bamyan Buddha (#1)** - Even stronger place specialist (1.71 score) with 53% career place rate over 47 starts. Won last start at Murray Bridge BM72 over 1600m. Course record of 3/19 with 16 places. At $9.00 offers +17% edge with 37% place probability. EW EV of +13.2%.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Teardrop Rotation** is the class runner dropping from BM84 Flemington - if runs to ability will be hard to beat
2. **Rain forecast** - track may deteriorate; Komachi handles soft (3 wins), Bamyan Buddha prefers good track (8 wins from 32 good, only 1 from 13 soft)
3. **I Catchem Fox** has outstanding place record (71%) and closed well last two - danger for minors
