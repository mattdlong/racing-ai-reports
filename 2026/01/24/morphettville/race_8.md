# Morphettville R8 | 1050m BM72
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 9r | Good 4

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Clarence has the best recent figures (BM82 placing), 3-5pts clear of field.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - Bristler and Outpost likely to roll forward, no dominant leader.
**Class**: Most runners are BM64-72 regulars; Noble Magnate dropping from Alice Springs open class.
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected on Good 4, rail position not specified.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Noble Magnate represents each-way value at $15. Fresh from two solid trials (won at Gawler, 2nd at Strathalbyn), this 6yo has a strong record at the 1000-1050m trip (3 wins from 14 starts). The inside barrier (1) is advantageous in a 9-horse field. While returning from 292 days off, the trial form suggests fitness is there. At $15/$3.75, the EW EV calculates to +27.5% - the only positive expectation play in the race.

## KEY RISKS

1. Long absence (292 days since race start) - relying on trial form
2. Rising from provincial Alice Springs to SA metro Morphettville

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

| Horse | Place Rate | Expected | Specialist Score |
|-------|------------|----------|------------------|
| Clarence | 74% | 53% | 1.40 |
| Bristler | 66% | 38% | 1.72 |
| Purfect Line | 63% | 36% | 1.75 |

Note: Clarence is market favorite but -8% edge makes it a WATCH only.
