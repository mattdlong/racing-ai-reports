## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Rec |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-----|
| 4 | Saint Boom | $8.00 | 51.3 | 13% | +4.0% | VALUE | 1.0u EW |
| 2 | All Too Mysti | $4.80 | 43.8 | 21% | +0.8% | WATCH | - |
| 8 | Brown Nose Day Gal | $4.80 | 42.3 | 21% | +0.8% | WATCH | - |

| 5 | Testing One Two | $7.00 | 38.5 | 14% | -2.0% | WATCH | - |
| 6 | Vaniteux | $7.50 | 36.2 | 13% | -2.5% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figures; Saint Boom's 1600m Balaklava win (95.64s) shows strong middle-distance form.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected with no clear leaders; suits on-pace/midfield runners.
**Class**: BM58 level; Saint Boom rising from CL1/CL2 wins with progressive profile.
**Bias**: Neutral bias detected (LOW confidence); no adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Saint Boom qualifies via Path B (Place Specialist) with 53% career place rate (8 placings from 15 starts) and specialist score of 2.14. The 4yo mare has won 2 of last 5 starts and placed in 4 of 5, showing consistent form at the trip. The $8.00 price offers value given the 67% place rate in recent form (4/2/1/3/1). Rising through the grades progressively with trainer Stephen Theodore in good form.

## KEY RISKS

1. Barrier 8 in 10-horse field - may need to go back from wide gate
2. First run at Morphettville course (1 prior start, 0 wins)

## MARKET LEADERS

| # | Horse | Odds | Place% | Specialist | Assessment |
|---|-------|------|--------|------------|------------|
| 2 | All Too Mysti | $4.80 | 58.4% | 1.59 | Joint-fav; 67% career place rate; inside draw; won LTO |
| 8 | Brown Nose Day Gal | $4.80 | 59.2% | 1.74 | Joint-fav; won LTO by 2.93L; excels on Good; tight price |

Both market leaders are strong place specialists but odds too short for EW value (Path A requires $6+).
