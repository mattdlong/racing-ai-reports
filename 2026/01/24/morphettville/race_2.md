# Morphettville R2 | 1050m BM70
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 6r | Good 4

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #1 SHISUTA BO @ $13.00/$4.50 - 1.5u EW**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Place% | Edge | Tier |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|--------|------|------|
| 3 | Mic Drop | $2.05 | 56.3 | 42% | 85% | -14% | VALUE |
| 4 | Daisydoo | $2.60 | 45.0 | 25% | 80% | -27% | WATCH |
| 1 | Shisuta Bo | $13.00 | 62.4 | 8% | 35% | +4% | EW_VALUE |
| 5 | Blanc Visage | $6.50 | 38.0 | 14% | 42% | -22% | WATCH |
| 7 | I Am Piki | $12.00 | 35.0 | 7% | 27% | -16% | PASS |
| 6 | In Love | $18.00 | 28.0 | 4% | 18% | -10% | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Mic Drop ran 60.63s winning at this C/D (BM64), fastest recent figure in field. Daisydoo 58.31s at Murray Bridge 1000m solid.

**Pace**: FAST shape expected - small field with multiple on-pace runners. Mic Drop and Daisydoo will vie for early lead from inner draws. Outsiders may benefit if leaders over-race.

**Class**: Mic Drop rising from BM64 to BM70 after dominant 1.2L win. Career trajectory strong (3/6, 50%). Shisuta Bo drops from stronger company, has hit boards in 21/30 starts (70%).

**Bias**: Rail true, no significant bias detected. Barrier 7 (Shisuta Bo) slight negative in 6-horse field but manageable.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Shisuta Bo** qualifies as EW VALUE via dual paths. Path A: Odds $13 >= $6, EW EV +22%, place prob 35% >= 30%. Path B: Strong place specialist score 3.125 (career 70% place rate from 30 starts). This mare has exceptional placing consistency - only 9 times out of the top 3 in 30 starts. Coming off a 48-day break but has two trial wins to indicate fitness. At $13/$4.50 EW, the place component alone offers +40% EV.

**Mic Drop** is the deserving favorite with a perfect C/D record (1/1) and 50% career win rate. However, at $2.05 the edge is negative (-14%). This is a watch/pass on the win market - odds need to drift to $2.40+ for value consideration.

## KEY RISKS

1. Shisuta Bo has no wins at 1050m (0/1) - all wins at 1400m+ (staying type)
2. Wide barrier (7) in small field means early extra ground
3. Rain forecast may deteriorate track - Shisuta Bo 0/7 on soft/heavy
