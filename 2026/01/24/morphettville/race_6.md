Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 9r | Good 4

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Bolt By | $18.00 | 58 | 12% | +116% | VALUE | 1.5% |

| 5 | Wild Winner | $7.00 | 52 | 14% | -2% | EW_VALUE | 0.75% |

| 9 | Thinkingnintynine | $14.00 | 45 | 8% | +12% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Bolt By has best recent figures at 1800m (wins at Clare 3.5L, Morphettville 2L), clearly suited to this trip.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - Conni Island likely leader from wide draw, Bolt By can settle midfield from barrier 1.
**Class**: BM72 provincial grade - Bolt By proven at this level with 2 wins from 5 at BM68-74 range.
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected on Good 4 track, no significant rail advantage.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Bolt By represents outstanding each-way value at $18. The 3yo gelding has won 2 of last 4 starts including a dominant 3.5L win at Clare over 1800m. Proven at C/D with 3 wins from 9 at the distance and experience at Morphettville (1 win from 13). The inside barrier is a positive in a 9-runner field and Dylan Caboche retains the ride. At odds of $18 the market severely underrates this horse's proven staying ability.

Wild Winner is the supreme place specialist with 78% career place rate (14 places from 18 starts). While no win chance at the trip, the $2.15 place odds offer value given the 43% calculated place probability.

## KEY RISKS

1. Bolt By has not won at Morphettville since Nov 2025 (2 starts since)
2. Rain forecast could shift track conditions and suit wet-trackers

## MARKET ANALYSIS

Market favors Coorong Tycoon ($3.30) and Conni Island ($3.80) - both lightly-raced improvers stepping up in trip. Neither has proven form at 1800m, making them underlays. Coorong Tycoon has no starts beyond 2000m with 0 wins at the distance. Conni Island has never started beyond 1507m.

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

| 5 | Wild Winner | 78% | 2.81 | STRONG SPECIALIST |
| 1 | Bolt By | 64% | 2.22 | STRONG SPECIALIST |
