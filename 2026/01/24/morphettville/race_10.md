# Morphettville R10 | 1200m BM76
Fri 24 Jan | 9:57am | 10r | Good 4

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #11 STOKOMO @ $8.00 - 1.0u E/W**

Path B Qualifier: Place Specialist (score 2.40)

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Tier | Notes |
|---|-------|------|------|--------|------|------|-------|
| 10 | Angel Torque | 3.00 | 26% | 70% | -16% | WATCH | Fav, short price |
| 7 | Thunder Shoc | 4.20 | 24% | 67% | +1% | WATCH | Fair price |
| 11 | Stokomo | 8.00 | 12% | 36% | -4% | EW VALUE | Place specialist |
| 12 | High On Sugar | 7.00 | 12% | 35% | -16% | PASS | |
| 8 | Star Sirius | 11.00 | 10% | 30% | -10% | PASS | Poor recent |
| 3 | Santastico | 12.00 | 8% | 28% | -4% | PASS | Wide draw |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Angel Torque (form: 1-5-3-1-2-3) and Thunder Shoc (form: 1-5-1-5-3-1) are the class acts. Both have recent 1200m wins but are priced accordingly with limited value.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no dominant leaders. Thunder Shoc and Angel Torque likely to sit handy; Stokomo settles midfield with a strong finish.

**Class**: BM76 grade. Thunder Shoc rising from BM64 win; Angel Torque comes off BM74 3rd. Stokomo up from CL2 level.

**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Good 4 surface suits most runners.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**STOKOMO** qualifies as Each-Way Value via Path B (Place Specialist). Career place rate of 69% (9/13) significantly exceeds expected 29% for a horse of this win probability. At $8.00 with place odds around $2.40, the EW proposition shows +3.0% combined EV. The 54% career place strike rate and recent form (1-2-2-5) suggests consistent placings at this level.

The two market fancies - Angel Torque ($3.00) and Thunder Shoc ($4.20) - are both solid horses but priced without margin. Angel Torque shows -16% edge despite good form; Thunder Shoc is around fair odds at +1% edge but doesn't meet Best Bet criteria (score 40.7).

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise for Stokomo from CL2 to BM76 - yet to win at metro level
2. Barrier 3 may get crowded if race develops scratchily
3. Rain forecast could alter track - check conditions before betting

## MARKET WATCH

- Angel Torque: Firmed from $3.50 to $3.00 - strong support
- Thunder Shoc: Drifted from $3.80 to $4.20 - some concern
- Stokomo: Steady at $8.00 - value window open
