## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Warchime showed strong staying form winning at Seymour (2021m) by 1.5L on Jan 15, the key reference run for this field. Thinking Gold has metro form but question marks at this trip.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No genuine leaders, Warchime and Mozu Marcassin likely to settle midfield and sustain. Suits runners who can grind.

**Class**: Competitive BM62. Warchime proven at this level (won LTO at BM62), Thinking Gold dropping from BM70 but widest draw, Motiver second at BM66 last start shows potential but untested at 2000m+.

**Bias**: Neutral bias expected (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. No significant barrier advantage detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Warchime** is the value play at $8.00. Won LTO at Seymour over 2021m in dominant fashion (1.5L margin, 127.31s). Proven stayer with 2 wins from 5 starts at this distance range. Good 4 track suits (5 wins, 8 places from 22 starts on good). The 6yo gelding has course form (1 win from 2 Cranbourne starts) and gets Dylan Dunn who knows him well. The +44% edge at these odds presents genuine value, with EW EV of +38%.

**Motiver** ($13) offers secondary value - consistent placer (57% place rate career) rising through grades, but first time at 2060m is a query despite 2nd at Geelong 2418m last start.

## KEY RISKS

1. Thinking Gold ($3.90 fav) - Peter Moody trained, Luke Nolen aboard, proven at BM62 level but wide barrier (10) and untested at this distance (only 1 start at 2500m)
2. Convo - Ciaron Maher mare with Michael Dee up, ran 2nd to Warchime LTO but drawn wide (9) again
