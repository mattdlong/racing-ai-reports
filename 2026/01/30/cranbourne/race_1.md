*Scratched: #3 I Am Titan, #8 Fiery Reign*

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited reliable speed figures - maiden/CL2 field with inconsistent form. Vieux Riche ran 84.88s over 1400m at Pakenham (3rd); Lisa Lass ran 84.24s over 1400m at Cranbourne (2nd).

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. No confirmed leaders - Vallo (bar 1) and Costa Paros likely to press forward from good draws. Lisa Lass typically settles back and finishes on.

**Class**: All runners are maidens or CL2 level. Lisa Lass has the highest average prize ($5,234) and best place strike rate (80%). Vieux Riche debuted with a creditable 3rd.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - neutral expected on Good 4. Rail position not specified. Weather showing rain which may impact late in meeting.

| 10 | Vieux Riche | 3 | $3.50 | 3 | 1/1 | 0/0 | 1/1 Good | Debut 3rd, strong J/T, short price |

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#10 VIEUX RICHE ($3.50)** - Market favourite off a single career start (3rd at Pakenham 1400m, 0.75L margin). Shane Jackson stable has a good strike rate with first-starters. Good barrier (3) and experienced jockey Shane Foley aboard. Risk: Only one run, untested at 1500m, short price leaves no margin for error.

**#1 ANIMAL ($3.70)** - Most experienced of the contenders with 6 starts. Two runner-up finishes including 2nd at this track last start over 1600m. Stepping back to 1500m suits. Career place rate 50%. Risk: Never won, barrier 6 neutral, form not progressing.

**#9 LISA LASS ($4.80)** - Outstanding place record (4 placings from 5 starts, 80% place rate). Strong place specialist score of 1.96. Consistent performer who keeps finding the frame. Aaron Purcell stable in form. Risk: Cannot win - four career 2nds suggests lacks finishing punch. Heavy track form (3/3 places) may not transfer to Good going.

**#5 COSTA PAROS ($5.00)** - Ben/Will/JD Hayes stable typically performs well with maidens. Ran 4th at this track last start. 3yo with upside. Risk: Wide barrier (9) problematic, only 33% place rate.

**#7 VALLO ($6.50)** - Best barrier draw (1). Ran 4th on debut at Pakenham 1400m. Only one start so limited form analysis possible. Risk: Inexperienced, unknown quantity.

## PLACE SPECIALIST ANALYSIS

**Lisa Lass (#9)** scores 1.96 on the place specialist index (STRONG classification):
- Actual place rate: 80%
- Expected place rate: 40.8%
- 4 placings from 5 starts

However, place odds of $1.62 provide only -4.8% EV on place component. Combined EW EV is -11.6%. Despite the specialist profile, the market has priced this accurately.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Maiden field unreliability** - All runners are maidens or CL2 performers with limited form to assess
2. **Market efficiency** - No positive edge identified; odds reflect or exceed true probabilities
3. **Weather impact** - Rain forecast may change track conditions during meeting

## MARKET ANALYSIS

- Market percentage: 124.1% (overround favours bookmaker)
- Favourite implied probability: 28.6% vs assessed 23%
- No value overlays identified
- Tightest margin: Vallo at -15.5% edge (still negative)
