| 7 | Cool Charlie | $51.00 | 30 | 3% | - | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Tookay Pete in career-best form with back-to-back wins at this track/distance, the only horse proven at Cranbourne 1000m.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - Auckland and Commands Success likely to push early, suits Tookay Pete's stalking style.
**Class**: BM56 suits the in-form Tookay Pete; Educated drops from maiden but 144 days off is significant concern.
**Bias**: Neutral bias, no significant style or barrier advantage detected (LOW confidence).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Tookay Pete at $13.00 represents outstanding each-way value. Won at this track/distance just 8 days ago (58.24s) and backed that up with another 1000m win at Yarra Valley 2 weeks prior. Career record of 4 wins and 10 placings from 20 starts (50% place rate) makes the place component highly attractive. The market has gravitated heavily to Educated ($1.65) but that filly has just one start (144 days ago over 1100m) and has never raced at 1000m - a significant unknown at prohibitive odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (7) may cost ground early
2. Weight of money on Educated - if the market is right, we lose

## EW VALUE PATH

**Path A Qualified**: Odds $13.00 >= $6, EW EV +50%, Place prob 36% >= 30%

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Win EV | +56% |
| Place EV | +44% |
| Combined EW EV | +50% |
| Place Odds | $2.60 |

*4. Machinist - SCRATCHED*

## MARKET ANALYSIS

Market percentage: 124% (standard country meeting)

The market has installed Educated as a $1.65 favorite despite:
- Only 1 career start (won maiden at Tatura 1100m)
- 144 days since last race
- Never raced at 1000m sprint distance
- Stepping into BM56 grade

This creates value in the proven performers, particularly Tookay Pete who has demonstrated current form at today's exact track/distance.
