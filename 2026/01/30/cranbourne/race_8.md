## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited recent times available; Valedictorian (84.62s/1400m at Cranbourne) and Eden Rose (82.87s/1400m at Flemington) show the best recent figures.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected - no obvious leaders; Valedictorian and Late Harvest likely to press, others settle midfield. Backmarkers may benefit if pace collapses.

**Class**: First-up from maidens for several runners stepping into BM62. Valedictorian won maiden impressively by 3.25L; Eden Rose placed 3rd in BM70 at Flemington (class test).

**Bias**: Neutral bias reported (LOW confidence). No significant advantage for leaders or closers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Navy Nina offers substantial each-way value at $15.00. Won a maiden over 1550m at Geelong on soft (1.75L margin), then placed 2nd in a 0-64 at Geelong over 1700m (1.25L behind winner). The step to 1500m suits her staying profile and the Hayes yard has her ready after solid jumpouts. She's a strong place specialist (80% place rate career) with proven form at the distance. Market underrates her place chances significantly - 32% place probability vs 27% implied by $3.60 place odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. Last start 9th of 9 at Geelong (1325m CL1) - shorter trip didn't suit
2. Good 4 track - all her wins/places on soft ground (3:1-2 soft vs 2:0-1 good)

## MARKET MOVES TO WATCH

- Valedictorian: $3.00 favourite, well supported after maiden win
- Eden Rose: $3.90 second elect, class edge from Flemington placing
