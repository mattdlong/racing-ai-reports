## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Mystic Reign has best recent figures - won at Flemington (63.67s/1100m) in quality company; Jennyanydots solid 57.73s/1000m win at Sandown.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - Honor Galore and Soju likely to press, Mystic Reign can stalk from barrier 6.
**Class**: Mystic Reign stepping up from maiden/BM64 wins but showed quality in 3YO races; Jennyanydots proven at BM70 level.
**Bias**: Neutral bias confidence LOW - no significant track pattern detected.

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

**Favorite**: Mystic Reign $2.90 (implied 34.5%)
- Last two runs 5th and 6th at Flemington - disappointing but excuses (resuming, class test)
- Has the class but concerning fresh-up form pattern
- 50% career win rate impressive but small sample (6 starts)

**Second Elect**: Jennyanydots $3.10 (implied 32.3%)
- Resuming after 131 days - won trial 19/01/26 over 850m
- 80% place rate career (8/10 starts) - consistent
- Best barrier draw (2) and proven distance form
- RED FLAG: Long break, previous prep faded late at BM70

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

| # | Horse | Place Rate | Expected | Specialist Score |
|---|-------|------------|----------|------------------|
| 4 | Honor Galore | 56% | 39% | 1.43 (YES) |
| 6 | Soju | 43% | 31% | 1.40 (YES) |

Both place specialists but EW EV negative at current odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Market efficiency** - compressed market with 122% overround leaves no value margin
2. **Resumers** - Jennyanydots (131 days), Sharing Moments (330 days), Honor Galore (163 days) all fitness queries
3. **Class unknown** - Mystic Reign untested at BM70 after soft wins

## WATCH NOTES

- **Mystic Reign** - If drifts to $3.50+ may offer marginal value; talented but needs to prove BM70 credentials
- **Honor Galore** - Course winner (1/2 at Cranbourne), best barrier, but off long break
- **Soju** - 6 starts at Cranbourne (2 wins), genuine C/D form, value if drifts to $9+
