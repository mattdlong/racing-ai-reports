**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected with Mr Assertive and Rich Lover likely to press forward; suits on-pace runners.
**Class**: All runners at grade; Blue Hawaiian rising from maiden/BM64 level, Escarpa competitive at BM66.
**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence on bias data).

| 12 | Blue Hawaiian | 5 | $2.60 | 2-2-1-2-6 | 86% | 1:1 | G:0/3 S:1/3 | 128d spell, won jump out, Moody/Nolen |

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Blue Hawaiian** (#12) is the deserved favorite with an exceptional 86% placing rate and course/distance credentials (won at Cranbourne 1200m). However, the $2.60 price implies 38% win probability when our assessment suggests 31% - a significant underlay of -19.4%. The 128-day layoff is a concern despite positive jump-out signals.

**Escarpa** (#10) benefits from barrier 1 and has been consistently placing at BM66 level, suggesting competitiveness dropping to BM62. But again, $3.20 offers no value with -23.2% edge.

**Mr Assertive** (#1) is the form horse after winning last start at Geelong BM62 by 2.75L. The place specialist score of 1.645 indicates strong placing ability, but winning is harder and $4.20 is insufficient.

## KEY RISKS

1. Blue Hawaiian first-up from long spell - trial form mixed and Good track record poor (0/3)
2. Tight market with 126% overround compressing value across the field
