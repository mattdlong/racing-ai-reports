*#8 Big Star scratched*

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Exit has best figures but resuming after 160 days off. Gliding Lightening won 2 of last 3 starts with competitive times. Sheanadh won debut impressively (1L margin, 71.61s for 1200m).

**Pace**: MODERATE scenario likely. Exit and Artie's Storm likely to press, Gliding Lightening and Sheanadh can settle midfield with cover. Grammy's Sunshine may go back from inside draw.

**Class**: BM70 provincial night meeting. Several lightly-raced 3yo fillies stepping up from maiden/BM64 level. Toronado Queen has 286-day layoff despite strong 2yo form.

**Bias**: Neutral bias at Cranbourne (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. Inside barriers slight advantage in small field.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Gliding Lightening** (Score: 84.0) qualifies via Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist). Won at Cranbourne over 1000m (10 Jan) then up in class. Peter Moody/Katherine Coleman yard with 33% strike rate. Place specialist score 1.49 with 50% career placing rate. Strong EW EV (+21.8%) justifies 1.5u each-way.

**Sheanadh** (Score: 73.0) qualifies via Path A. Only start was impressive 1L debut win at Mornington over this distance. Mark Walker with Michael Dee aboard (strong jockey booking). Perfect 100% career placing rate gives specialist score of 2.38. Second-up now after jumpout. Barrier 3 ideal. EW EV +11.4%.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Exit** (fav $2.40): Ciaron Maher filly resuming after 160 days. Market dominated by stable confidence, but form reads 9x135x - inconsistent. No value at current price but could still win.
2. **Toronado Queen** (#3): 286-day layoff is significant concern despite winning trial. Last race was April 2025. Fitness unknown.
3. **Weather**: Rain forecast may shift track to Soft range - monitor. Gliding Lightening untested on wet, Exit better on Soft.
