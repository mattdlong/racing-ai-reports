## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Explicit the most consistent - 3rd at Kensington (1400m soft) LT, 2nd Rosehill prior. So Rebellious placed 3 of last 5 including 3rd in open barrier trial last start.

**Class**: BM64 level suits both runners. Explicit has solid maiden/benchmark form at comparable level. So Rebellious dropping from open barrier trial.

**Distance**: Explicit has one 1600m start (3rd Kembla), gets up in trip naturally. So Rebellious ran 4th at Canterbury 1550m (Dec 19) - key C/D form.

**Conditions**: Rain forecast but currently Good 4. Explicit 2 from 2 placings on soft - handles give. So Rebellious softer ground ok (3 starts, 1 placing).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Explicit** represents genuine value at $9.00. The Ryan/Alexiou-trained 3yo has placed in 3 of 6 starts and improved to 3rd last start at Kensington on soft. Gets up to 1550m which should suit - ran a strong 3rd over 1600m at Kembla Grange in May. Chad Schofield a capable jockey booking. The wide barrier (7 of 8) is manageable in small field with even tempo expected.

**So Rebellious** at $13 offers overlay value. Has C/D experience (4th at Canterbury 1550m) and consistent placings. Coming off open-class barrier trial where ran competitive 3rd behind quality opposition - that's a positive sign for fitness.

## KEY RISKS

1. Explicit: Wide barrier may cost ground if pace is slow
2. So Rebellious: Yet to win from 8 starts - placings specialist?
3. Weather: Rain may deteriorate track - monitor conditions

## MARKET WATCH

**Baja Baby (#1)** is overbet at $2.80 with only 1 career start. The O'Shea/Charlton runner ran 2nd on debut at Kembla (1300m soft) but stepping up 250m and taking on more seasoned opposition. Market support based on stable confidence but price doesn't reflect risk.

**Equinox Legend (#5)** came 3rd last start at Warwick Farm 1400m but that run may be overhyped. Price of $4.20 offers no edge. Needs to find improvement stepping to 1550m.
