# Canterbury R4 | 1250m BM74
Thu 30 Jan | 7:30pm | 8r | Good 4 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET - Insufficient edge across field**

Market is tight. Favorite Johnny well-supported but stepping up in trip with questions to answer. No value found at current prices.

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Johnny has the best recent form (1-2-2) and won last start at Randwick over 1050m. Watson broke maiden last start impressively, winning by 2.8L at Kembla. Extra Heights won at this track/distance two weeks ago on Soft.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No confirmed leaders, likely genuine tempo with Johnny and Watson both looking to settle forward. Suits on-pace runners.

**Class**: BM74 metro represents a rise for most. Johnny stepping up from barrier trials/restricted; Watson from maiden; Extra Heights from BM68. Calga Power most exposed at this level (75% place rate from 8 starts).

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - no adjustment applied. Rain forecast may soften track.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#8 JOHNNY ($2.90)** - 3yo Snowden gelding with three wins from five starts. Won last at Randwick 1050m by 0.1L in 64.1s. Concern: untested at 1250m (only run 1200m once for 5th). Heavy track specialist (1:3-3 record) but today's Good 4 may not suit. Inside barrier (3) an advantage.

**#10 WATSON ($3.80)** - 3yo Waterhouse/Bott gelding improving rapidly. Broke maiden impressively last start at Kembla 1300m, winning by 2.8L. Distance suits, but wide barrier (9) concerning at tight Canterbury. Jockey Tim Clark a positive.

**#6 CALGA POWER ($3.90)** - 4yo Lees gelding with exceptional consistency (2:6 from 8 starts, 75% place rate). Last two runs: 3rd Kensington 1100m, 2nd Beaumont 800m trial. Lightly raced and progressive but needs to prove at BM74 level.

**#7 EXTRA HEIGHTS ($6.50)** - 3yo Snowden colt with C:D win here 16/01. Won by 1.72L over 1250m on Soft 7. Key query: that was only his third start and just a BM68 field of 6. Chad Schofield retains ride.

**#3 ORYX ($12.00)** - 7yo Richard Litt gelding. Consistent place performer (4:11 from 26 starts). 0:7 at Canterbury concerning. Best form on Good tracks. EW calculation showed +8% combined EV - borderline interest at the price.

## EACH-WAY ASSESSMENT

| Horse | Win EV | Place EV | EW EV | Verdict |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|---------|
| Oryx $12 | -4.0% | +20.0% | +8.0% | Borderline |
| Zale $13 | -22.0% | 0% | -11.0% | No value |
| Angara $20 | -20.0% | +3.5% | -8.3% | No value |

Oryx shows marginal EW value but lacks win upside (0:7 at Canterbury). Pass.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Johnny distance query** - First run at 1250m, all wins 1000-1100m
2. **Watson wide barrier** - Draw 9 at tight Canterbury track, likely to get back
3. **Track may deteriorate** - Rain forecast, could shift to Soft and change complexion

## RECOMMENDATION

**PASS** - No actionable edge identified. Market has correctly priced Johnny as clear favorite but price is short given trip uncertainty. Watson and Calga Power offer no value at current odds. If Johnny drifts to $3.50+ or Oryx to $15+, reassess.
