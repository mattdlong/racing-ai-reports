# Canterbury R2 | 1250m CL1
Thu 30 Jan | 6:30pm | 7r | Good 4

## ACTION

**NO BET - Insufficient edge at current prices**

Favorite #8 Impuriteze is the clear form horse but $2.70 offers no value against assessed 35% win probability. Second pick #10 Scrumptious has wide barrier concern at tight Canterbury track.

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Impuriteze has the best recent form with consecutive 2nds at Gosford (1200m Good) and Beaumont (1350m Soft). Has proven she stays 1200m+ and handles varying track conditions. Scrumptious hit form with a Randwick 2nd but flopped at Gold Coast last start.

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected. No genuine leader in this field - expect a few to push forward early. Impuriteze can settle handy from barrier 1 and have every chance.

**Class**: Weak CL1 event. Several runners with limited exposed form. Impuriteze and Scrumptious have the most race experience and placings at this level.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - no significant bias adjustment applied. Canterbury typically favors inside barriers at 1250m which suits Impuriteze (1) over Scrumptious (9) and Military Legend (10).

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#8 IMPURITEZE** - $2.70 (Fav)
- Form: 4-5-x-2-2 | Career: 4 starts, 0 wins, 2 places (50%)
- Last run: 2nd Beaumont 1350m Soft, 2.4L behind winner (15/01)
- Prior: 2nd Gosford 1200m Good, 0.95L (31/12)
- Pros: Inside barrier, proven at distance, consistent placer
- Cons: Has yet to win, short price for maiden filly
- Assessment: Deserves favoritism but $2.70 is under fair value (~$2.86)

**#10 SCRUMPTIOUS** - $3.30
- Form: x-2-2-4-x-9 | Career: 5 starts, 0 wins, 2 places (40%)
- Last run: 9th Gold Coast 1100m Soft (17/01) - forgive this
- Prior: 2nd Randwick 1050m Good, 1.18L (30/12)
- Pros: Waterhouse/Bott stable, Tim Clark booking
- Cons: Wide barrier 9 at Canterbury, inconsistent
- Assessment: Chance if she can offset barrier but $3.30 too short

**#1 ALPHARD** - $4.00
- Form: 4-5-x | Career: 2 starts, 0 wins, 0 places
- Last run: 195 days ago - resuming without a public trial
- Pros: Waller/McDonald combination, inside barrier
- Cons: First-up without trial, limited race experience
- Assessment: Trust the stable but blind betting on resumers risky

**#7 COCO DIOR** - $7.50
- Form: 3-x | Career: 1 start, 0 wins, 1 place (100%)
- Last run: 2nd Kembla Grange 800m Good (06/01)
- Pros: Hit the line well fresh, handles good ground
- Cons: Yet to race beyond 800m, big step up to 1250m
- Assessment: Interesting but distance query warrants caution

## KEY RISKS

1. **Favorite query**: Impuriteze has yet to win from 4 starts - may be a place specialist
2. **Wide barriers**: Scrumptious (9) and Military Legend (10) face disadvantage at Canterbury's tight track
3. **Rain forecast**: If track deteriorates, form lines could change

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market percentage: 122.5% (standard overround)

| Horse | Market Odds | Implied % | Assessed % | Edge |
|-------|-------------|-----------|------------|------|
| Impuriteze | $2.70 | 37.0% | 35% | -5.5% |
| Scrumptious | $3.30 | 30.3% | 22% | -17.5% |
| Alphard | $4.00 | 25.0% | 15% | -40.0% |
| Coco Dior | $7.50 | 13.3% | 10% | -25.0% |

No overlay detected in this market. The favorite Impuriteze is closest to fair value but still offers negative edge at $2.70.

## VERDICT

**PASS** - No betting interest in this race.

Impuriteze is the most likely winner but odds of $2.70 provide insufficient compensation for a maiden filly who has yet to break through. Would need $3.20+ to consider a bet.

If forced to have an opinion: Impuriteze to win, with Scrumptious and Alphard the main dangers for exotic purposes only.
