## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Ivan's Hero (33112) and It's A Wonder (5183) show the best recent sequences. Bat Out Of Hell consistent placegetter (64% place rate career) but win rate low (12%).

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected with no dominant leader. Suit Of Armour and It's A Wonder are closers who may benefit if pace is genuine. Centenario and Ivan's Hero can stalk.

**Class**: BM72 grade with several horses exposed at this level. Ivan's Hero won BM64 and ran 2nd in similar last start. It's A Wonder has BM72 placing form and a win at BM72 level when fresh.

**Track/Going**: Good 4 suits most runners. It's A Wonder has better wet track form (2 wins, 4 places from 6 soft/heavy) if rain arrives as forecast. Bat Out Of Hell handles all conditions.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**It's A Wonder** at $9.50 offers genuine each-way value in a race where the market has overreacted to a poor last start (10th at Kensington over 1800m). That run can be forgiven - stretched to 1800m after racing keenly. Her BM72 form at 1400-1600m is solid with a win at Rosehill and multiple placings. Joshua Parr retains the ride, trainer Gerald Ryan/Sterling Alexiou in good form, and the 1550m at Canterbury suits her running pattern. The rain forecast could further advantage her wet track record. At odds, represents the best value in the field.

**Bat Out Of Hell** is the clear favourite at $2.90 but offers no value. While his consistency is undeniable (64% place rate, C: 11-1-8), his 12% win rate flags a place-only profile. Tim Clark aboard is positive but the price is too short for a horse that places more than wins.

**Ivan's Hero** at $3.80 is the logical danger with form reading 33112. However, Siena Grima's 3kg claim reduces weight benefit and the apprentice booking on a genuine metro Saturday night suggests stable has modest expectations.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rain forecast could significantly alter track conditions - monitor for downgrades
2. Suit Of Armour resuming after 723 days is a wildcard - 2 wins from 6 starts but huge query on fitness
