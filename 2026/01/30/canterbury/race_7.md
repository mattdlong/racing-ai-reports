| 7 | Maybe Moet | 7.50 | 38.4 | 11% | -18% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Ringarosa (3:2-3-1-4) brings excellent course form with 7 Canterbury starts (1 win, consistent placings). Monte Kate (1:1-5-x-2) comes off a fighting 2nd at Kensington over this trip.

**Class**: Both value runners are seasoned BM72 performers. Ringarosa won Bathurst feature last prep at this level. Monte Kate dropping from BM78 assignment is a positive.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Multiple on-pace types (Monte Kate, Berezka) should ensure genuine speed. Ringarosa can settle midfield and finish over them.

**Bias**: Track bias unknown (LOW confidence) - no adjustment applied. Good 4 surface suits most runners.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Ringarosa** (#3) represents the standout each-way value. The 7yo mare has outstanding place consistency (63% career, 1.87 specialist score) and thrives at Canterbury (7 starts, consistent placings). Coming off a strong 2nd over course/distance two weeks ago, she's ideally placed to run into the money again. At $9.50, the market underrates her chances - EW EV of +29% makes this a compelling play.

**Monte Kate** (#1) provides backup value at $7.50. The mare has won 4 from 22 with 50% place strike rate (1.89 specialist score). Her recent 2nd at Kensington (1250m, Soft) shows she's in form, and she handles the Good 4 surface. The market favorite Happy Bellie ($4.00) looks vulnerable - lightly raced, barrier 9, and unproven at this trip.

## KEY RISKS

1. Ringarosa: 7yo at end of career; may be on decline
2. Monte Kate: Barrier 6 in 9-horse field needs clean run
3. Happy Bellie: If reproduces maiden win form, hard to beat

| 11 | She Moves Too | 1 | 10.00 | 2-7-1-x | 0/0, 0/1 | 67% | - | PASS |

## GREEN LIGHTS

- Ringarosa: Proven C/D, consistent placer, class suited
- Monte Kate: Recent winning form, distance specialist, drops in class
- Both: Strong place specialist scores (>1.3)

## RED FLAGS

- Ringarosa: Age (7yo), no recent win
- Monte Kate: Top weight (63kg), barrier needs luck
- Happy Bellie: Wide draw (9), unproven at trip, short price
