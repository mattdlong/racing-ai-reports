# Canterbury R3 | 1100m BM78
Thu 30 Jan | 7:00pm | 8r | Good 4 | Rain

## ACTION

**VALUE: #7 RASKOL @ $11.00 - 0.8u EW**

Secondary: #5 Ready To Shine @ $12 - WATCH (wide draw concern)

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Albany Road posted 63.53s winning at Kensington (1100m Soft) - best recent figure. Agarwood's trial times unknown but won impressively in weaker grades.

**Pace**: MODERATE - no pronounced leaders. Albany Road and Agarwood likely to sit handy. Raskol can utilize inside draw to get perfect position.

**Class**: Agarwood stepping up significantly (146 days off, no 1100m form). Albany Road rising from BM72 win. Raskol jumps sharply after maiden win - genuine class query.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - neutral assumed. Inside draws (1-3) typically advantaged at Canterbury 1100m.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#7 Raskol** offers genuine each-way value at $11. Peter Snowden filly showed ability winning maiden at Canterbury 1200m on soft (70.41s). Inside draw (1) is crucial at Canterbury. The 1100m is a slight query dropping back in trip but she showed speed winning her maiden trial by 2+ lengths. At 12% assessed chance vs 9% implied, there's solid overlay. EW returns of $2.05 place represent value given 38% place probability.

The favorite **#4 Agarwood** is talented but 146 days off with no 1100m form is concerning. J McDonald booking is positive but $1.85 offers no margin for error. Fair odds ~$2.85.

**#6 Albany Road** won well last start but $2.60 is too short against an in-form Agarwood.

## KEY RISKS

1. Raskol dropping 100m in trip - untested at 1100m in races
2. Agarwood's class could be superior if she fires fresh
3. Rain forecast may shift track to Soft - Raskol handles it (2/2 on Soft)

*Scratched: #3 Stormland*

## GREEN LIGHTS / RED FLAGS

**#7 Raskol**
- GREEN: Inside barrier (1), C/D winner, Snowden stable, handles Soft
- RED: Class rise from maiden, untested 1100m

**#4 Agarwood**
- GREEN: J McDonald, class, natural ability
- RED: 146 days off, no 1100m form, short price
