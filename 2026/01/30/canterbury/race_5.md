## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Doradus has consistent recent form at 1900m Canterbury (2nd last start, 4th two back). Marebello improving but untested at this trip.

**Pace**: MODERATE anticipated - Doradus and Tokyo Star likely to settle midfield. No dominant leaders; genuine staying test expected.

**Class**: BM68 level suits Doradus (won CL1-SW, placed BM64). Marebello rising sharply from maiden win. Emballee stepping up from BM64.

**Bias**: Track bias unknown (LOW confidence) - no adjustment applied. Good 4 surface suits most runners.

## FIELD ASSESSMENT

**#2 DORADUS ($3.50)** - Favourite. C/D experience (4 starts Canterbury, 1 win at 1900m). Last two runs at this track/distance: 2nd by 1.97L, 4th by 0.36L. Consistent placer (44% place strike). Wide barrier (12) concern but has gate speed. J McDonald aboard = elite jockey. **QUERY**: Wide draw negates some appeal.

**#6 MAREBELLO ($3.80)** - Progressive type from Waller yard with J McDonald. Won maiden impressively last start at Kembla (1600m Soft). First start at 1900m but breeding suggests stamina. 80% place strike rate (4/5). Inside draw (5) advantage. **QUERY**: Untested at distance; rising sharply in class from maiden.

**#7 EMBALLEE ($4.20)** - Consistent mare with 38% place rate. Third at Canterbury last start (1550m). Drawn wide (11) but Tim Clark competent. Previous runs at this track suggest competence. **QUERY**: Hasn't won beyond 1600m; 1900m query.

**#9 TOKYO STAR ($7.00)** - Place chance specialist (40% place rate). Fourth here last start at 1900m (beaten 1.97L). Excels on soft going (2 wins, 3 places from 9 soft starts). Tommy Berry booking positive. **QUERY**: Barrier 9 neutral; needs soft track to excel.

**#10 MAD ANA ($10.00)** - Distance winner (2 wins from 2 starts at ~1900m). Coming off a win at Ballina 1920m. First Canterbury start but proven stayer. Light weight (54kg) advantage. **QUERY**: Provincial form; stepping up to metro.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

This is a competitive staying handicap with the market correctly identifying **Doradus** as the likely winner based on course/distance credentials and consistency. However, the $3.50 price offers no value with edge calculated at -2.0%.

**Marebello** presents intrigue as a progressive Waller runner but the $3.80 price for a horse unproven at 1900m rising sharply from maiden ranks is prohibitive.

The lack of clear value edge across the field suggests this is a **watching brief** rather than a betting race. The market is efficient.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Weather**: Rain forecast may shift track to Soft - benefits Tokyo Star, potentially challenges Marebello (untested wet)
2. **Wide barriers**: Doradus (12), Emballee (11) both drawn awkwardly on tight Canterbury track
3. **Class rise**: Marebello and Barcelo both stepping significantly up in grade

## PLACE PROBABILITIES

| # | Horse | Place Prob | Place Odds | Place EV |
|---|-------|------------|------------|----------|
| 2 | Doradus | 72.8% | $1.40 | -21.1% |
| 6 | Marebello | 67.6% | $1.50 | +1.4% |
| 9 | Tokyo Star | 38.9% | $2.05 | -20.3% |
| 10 | Mad Ana | 25.1% | $2.63 | -34.0% |
