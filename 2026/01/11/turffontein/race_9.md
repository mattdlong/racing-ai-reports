# Turffontein Race 9 - Pinnacle Stakes (1160m)
**Sunday 11 January 2026 | 9:45 PM SAST | Pinnacle Stakes | Prize TBC**

---

## RACE OVERVIEW

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Track | Turffontein Standside (Gauteng) |
| Distance | 1160m |
| Class | Pinnacle Stakes (Open) |
| Surface | Soft |
| Rail | True |
| Weather | Overcast |
| Field Size | 13 runners |
| Track Bias | No significant bias |
| Pace Scenario | MODERATE |

**Race Synopsis**: A quality sprint over 1160m featuring a mix of proven stakes performers and progressive types. The likely pace scenario is moderate with a couple of keen runners expected to press forward, but no confirmed tearaway leader. Horses with tactical speed from mid-barriers appear advantaged. The soft track condition will suit runners with proven wet-track credentials, though most of the field have demonstrated versatility across conditions.

---

## PACE MAP

```
LEADERS (1-2L):
  #1 William Robertson - On-pace runner, will be prominent
  #3 Pistol Pete - Can sit handy

PRESSING (2-4L):
  #4 Fatal Flaw - Will be forward
  #2 Barbaresco - Likely to press

MIDFIELD (4-6L):
  #6 Almond Sea - Settles midfield, strong finisher <- VALUE
  #7 Chasing Happiness - Midfield runner
  #5 Greaterix - Settles worse than midfield

BACKMARKERS (6L+):
  #8 Dreamland - Back marker
  #9 Elegant Ice - Back of midfield
  #13 Magic Tattoo - Back runner with late dash
```

**Pace Analysis**: William Robertson and Pistol Pete are both versatile and can sit handy. With no confirmed leader wanting to burn, expect a moderate tempo that should suit horses with tactical speed. The soft track may blunt some of the speed, creating opportunities for strong finishers from midfield.

## CONTENDER ANALYSIS

### #3 PISTOL PETE [4 stars]
**Progressive 4yo building an impressive record in stakes company**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 9/10 | Won G3 Merchants 1st-up, 3rd G3 HCP 2nd-up |
| Class | 9/10 | Proven at G3 level, competitive in this grade |
| Distance | 8/10 | 2 wins from 8 at 1160m, improving |
| Track/Condition | 8/10 | 5 wins from 12 at Turffontein, 2/3 on Soft |
| Barrier/Map | 7/10 | Barrier 10 needs luck but can be ridden positively |
| Connections | 9/10 | Tony Peter in form, Gavin Lerena top jockey |
| Fitness/Prep | 9/10 | Third-up, won third-up previously, peak fitness |
| **Weighted Total** | **8.5/10** | |

**Form String**: 15840x6x13

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 27/12 | Turffontein | 1000m | 3/13 | 0.8L | 61.5kg | R Fourie | G3 - ran on well behind Taxi To The Moon |
| 29/11 | Turffontein | 1160m | 1/14 | 0.7L | 57.5kg | R Fourie | G3 Merchants - strong 1st-up win |
| 18/09 | Vaal | 1200m | 6/7 | 4.6L | 58kg | C Habib | Needed run after spell |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 32%
- Market Implied: ~29%
- Fair Odds: $3.13
- Current Odds: $3.50
- Edge: +11%
- Value: YES

**Strengths:**
- Third-up and firing - won G3 Merchants 1st-up, close 3rd in G3 last start
- Strong record at Turffontein (5 wins from 12 runs)
- Proven on soft tracks (2 wins from 3 starts)
- Progressive 4yo still improving
- Elite jockey Gavin Lerena engaged

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Barrier 10 requires luck or positive ride
- Stepping up from 1000m to 1160m (though has won at this trip)
- Weight increase to 60kg from 57.5kg last win

**Verdict**: The clear top pick. Won impressively first-up in the G3 Merchants over 1160m, then ran an excellent third in G3 grade over 1000m behind Taxi To The Moon. Now third-up and ready to peak. The 1160m suits and he has strong form at Turffontein. Gavin Lerena is the right man for the job. The slight drift in odds provides value.

### #6 ALMOND SEA [3 stars]
**Consistent mare with strong place record at the trip**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 8/10 | 2nd last start, competitive throughout prep |
| Class | 7/10 | Solid at open level, yet to win in stakes |
| Distance | 7/10 | 1 win, 2 placings from 6 at 1160m |
| Track/Condition | 8/10 | 4 wins from 12 at Turffontein |
| Barrier/Map | 8/10 | Barrier 6 ideal for settling midfield |
| Connections | 8/10 | Tony Peter stable firing, Craig Zackey solid |
| Fitness/Prep | 7/10 | Fresh after 43-day break, has won fresh |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.6/10** | |

**Form String**: x32155x432

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 29/11 | Turffontein | 1160m | 2/19 | 0.7L | 61.5kg | S Moodley | Narrowly beaten by Mia Moo |
| 09/11 | Turffontein | 1000m | 3/10 | 1.75L | 61kg | G Lerena | Solid 3rd behind Whistle The Tune |
| 26/10 | Turffontein | 1160m | 4/8 | 4.9L | 58kg | S Moodley | Ran on without threatening |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 22%
- Market Implied: ~20%
- Fair Odds: $4.55
- Current Odds: $5.00
- Edge: +10%
- Value: YES

**Strengths:**
- Excellent 76.92% place strike rate in career
- Narrowly beaten last start over this trip
- 43-day freshen should have her spot-on
- Barrier 6 perfect for midfield settling
- Gets in well at the weights (56kg)

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Yet to win at stakes level
- First-up record (2 wins from 4) not as strong as some rivals
- May find Pistol Pete too good

**Verdict**: Consistent performer who went close last start over this trip. The 43-day break is a concern, but she has won first-up before and her trainer Tony Peter knows how to have them ready. The 56kg is an attractive weight and barrier 6 is ideal. Strong each-way claims and should be running on at the finish.

### #1 WILLIAM ROBERTSON [3 stars]
**Classy older sprinter with stakes credentials but recent form patchy**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 6/10 | 7th last two, well beaten |
| Class | 8/10 | G1 winner, proven stakes performer |
| Distance | 9/10 | Outstanding: 7 wins, 5 places from 19 at 1160m |
| Track/Condition | 9/10 | 8 wins from 22 at Turffontein, 2/8 Soft |
| Barrier/Map | 7/10 | Barrier 9 manageable for this on-pacer |
| Connections | 7/10 | Corne Spies reliable, Ryan Munger good |
| Fitness/Prep | 6/10 | Form has tapered off, possibly peaking |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.3/10** | |

**Form String**: 57752

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 27/12 | Turffontein | 1000m | 7/13 | 4.3L | 64kg | T Mayhew | G3 - outpaced under big weight |
| 11/12 | Vaal | 1000m | 5/8 | 6.2L | 62kg | T Mayhew | Open - never in hunt |
| 29/11 | Turffontein | 1400m | 7/9 | 3.3L | 60.5kg | T Mayhew | Distance too far |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 20%
- Market Implied: ~25%
- Fair Odds: $5.00
- Current Odds: $4.00
- Edge: -5%
- Value: NO (slight underlay)

**Strengths:**
- Outstanding 1160m record (7 wins from 19)
- Proven G1 winner (won G1 at this track in March 2025)
- Best at Turffontein with 8 wins from 22
- High barrier (9) suits racing style

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Recent form is a concern - 7th last two starts
- Now 7yo, may be past peak
- Top weight of 62kg could anchor him
- Last win was March 2025 (10 months ago)

**Verdict**: The expert tips suggest this "top class sprinter should go close from a nice high draw." His form figures at the trip are outstanding, and the drop back from 1000m to 1160m suits. However, recent form is a worry with two consecutive 7th placings. The 62kg is a burden but he's won under similar weights before. Place claims but may struggle against the progressive types.

### #5 GREATERIX [3 stars]
**Smart 4yo resuming from Mike de Kock stable**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 6/10 | Disappointing last prep, but has ability |
| Class | 8/10 | Won G3, placed G1 - quality runner |
| Distance | 6/10 | Only 1/3 at 1160m, better over further |
| Track/Condition | 7/10 | 3 wins from 9 at Turffontein |
| Barrier/Map | 8/10 | Barrier 4 good for settling |
| Connections | 9/10 | De Kock yard, Raymond Danielson aboard |
| Fitness/Prep | 6/10 | First-up after 63 days, query |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.0/10** | |

**Form String**: 13124x674x

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 12%
- Market Implied: ~14%
- Fair Odds: $8.33
- Current Odds: $7.00
- Edge: -8%
- Value: NO

**Strengths:**
- Won G3 Dobie Mile in January 2025
- Mike de Kock stable know how to have them ready first-up
- Good barrier (4) for midfield settling
- Has won first-up before

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Last two runs very disappointing (4th of 7, 7th of 8)
- Better suited over 1400m-1600m based on record
- First-up after 63-day break
- Only 1 win from 3 at 1160m

**Verdict**: The expert assessment notes he "disappointed last time but is better than that and should have come on from the run." However, the 1160m is short of his best trip, and resuming after two poor runs raises concern. The de Kock stable factor adds interest, but he needs to recapture his best form. Place at best.

### #2 BARBARESCO [3 stars]
**Consistent galloper who should appreciate soft track**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 6/10 | 7th in G3 last start, 12th in G2 prior |
| Class | 7/10 | G2 placed, competitive at this level |
| Distance | 8/10 | 2 wins, 2 places from 6 at 1160m |
| Track/Condition | 7/10 | 2 wins from 13 at Turffontein |
| Barrier/Map | 9/10 | Barrier 13 suits - expert tip mentions "nice high draw" |
| Connections | 7/10 | Janse van Vuuren stable, Keagan de Melo |
| Fitness/Prep | 6/10 | 43 days since last run |
| **Weighted Total** | **6.9/10** | |

**Form String**: 7x3675

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 10%
- Market Implied: ~10%
- Fair Odds: $10.00
- Current Odds: $10.00
- Edge: 0%
- Value: FAIR

**Strengths:**
- Expert tip: "Was most unlucky last time and can make amends from another nice high draw"
- 60% place strike rate in career
- Soft track suits (1/5 but ran well)
- High barrier (13) actually helps at Turffontein Standside

**Vulnerabilities:**
- 43 days since last run
- Recent form unconvincing (7th, 12th last two)
- Better over 1400m-1600m than 1160m

**Verdict**: The expert selection for this race, with the reasoning that he was unlucky last time and the high barrier suits. At $10, represents fair value for place exotic inclusion.

## MARKET ANALYSIS

| Horse | Expected Open | Current | Move | Assessment |
|-------|---------------|---------|------|------------|
| #3 Pistol Pete | $3.00 | $3.50 | Drift | Value emerging |
| #1 William Robertson | $4.50 | $4.00 | Firm | Market support but form query |
| #6 Almond Sea | $5.50 | $5.00 | Firm | Each-way interest |
| #2 Barbaresco | $12.00 | $10.00 | Firm | Expert tip backing |
| #5 Greaterix | $8.00 | $7.00 | Firm | De Kock factor |

**Market Intelligence**: Pistol Pete has drifted from expected price, providing value for those who rated him highly. William Robertson is firming on the strength of his track record despite recent poor form. Barbaresco has attracted support following expert recommendations about being unlucky last start.

---

## EXPERT CONSENSUS

| Source | Selection | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Form-guide.com.au | #3 Pistol Pete | "Did a good job last start to finish 3rd in G3, rock-hard fit, likely to feature" |
| David Thiselton | #2 Barbaresco | "Most unlucky last time, can make amends from nice high draw" |
| Racing Preview | #1 William Robertson | "Top class sprinter should go close from nice high draw" |

**Consensus**: Split market with Pistol Pete the form pick but William Robertson the sentimental choice on track record. Barbaresco an expert fancy at value odds.

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Key Risks:**
1. Soft track could play differently than expected - may favour on-pacers more
2. Pistol Pete's barrier (10) requires a positive ride or traffic luck
3. William Robertson's recent form decline may be age-related

**Watch Factors:**
- Early speed: Monitor who leads - if genuine leader emerges, will change dynamics
- Track condition: Any further deterioration will favour wet-trackers
- Market moves: Late money for any runner could signal stable confidence

**Scenarios:**
- Best case: Pistol Pete settles handy, Lerena gets a clear run, strong finish
- Worst case: Wide barrier costs Pistol Pete ground, William Robertson reverts to best form
- Most likely: Pistol Pete and Almond Sea fill first two, trifecta includes Barbaresco

## BETTING STRATEGY

### Primary Selection
**#3 PISTOL PETE - WIN @ $3.50+**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | 4 stars |
| True Probability | 32% |
| Fair Odds | $3.13 |
| Current Odds | $3.50 |
| Edge | +11% |
| Stake | 2.0 units |

**Rationale**: Third-up and primed after an impressive G3 win first-up and quality third in G3 last start. The 1160m trip suits, Turffontein form is excellent, and Gavin Lerena is the right man to navigate from barrier 10. The slight drift in odds provides value against a field lacking a clear standout.

### Secondary Selection
**#6 ALMOND SEA - EACH-WAY @ $5.00+**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | 3 stars |
| True Probability | 22% |
| Fair Odds | $4.55 |
| Current Odds | $5.00 |
| Edge | +10% |
| Stake | 1.5 units (0.75u Win, 0.75u Place) |

**Rationale**: Unlucky last start when narrowly beaten at this trip. Gets in well at 56kg, ideal barrier, and the Tony Peter stable has both her and the top pick firing. Strong place credentials with 77% career place strike rate.

### Exotic Strategy

**Quinella**: 3/6
- Rationale: Both Tony Peter runners in excellent form, likely to fill the exacta

**Trifecta**: 3/6 -> 3/6 -> 1,2,5
- Rationale: Box Pistol Pete and Almond Sea for first two, include form horses for third

**First Four**: 3/6/1,2/1,2,5,7
- Rationale: Top two selections over William Robertson and Barbaresco, add Greaterix and Chasing Happiness for depth

---

## FINAL SUMMARY

| Bet | Selection | Odds | Stake | Confidence |
|-----|-----------|------|-------|------------|
| WIN | #3 Pistol Pete | $3.50+ | 2.0u | 4 stars |
| E/W | #6 Almond Sea | $5.00+ | 1.5u | 3 stars |
| QNL | 3/6 | ~$7 | 1.0u | 3 stars |
| TRI | 3,6/3,6/1,2,5 | ~$30 | 0.5u | 3 stars |

**Overall Confidence**: 4 stars

**Key Takeaway**: Pistol Pete is the quality bet in this race. A progressive 4yo third-up and ready to peak, he has the form, the track record, and the right jockey. Almond Sea from the same stable provides excellent each-way value. Avoid sinking money into William Robertson who, despite his excellent record at the trip, has shown signs of decline with two consecutive 7th placings.
