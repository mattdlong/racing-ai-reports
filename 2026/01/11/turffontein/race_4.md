# Turffontein Race 4 - Classic Day 7 March Maiden Plate (1000m)
**Sunday 11 January 2026 | 11:50 AM | Maiden Plate (F & M) | R10,110**

---

## RACE OVERVIEW

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Track | Turffontein Standside (Gauteng) |
| Distance | 1000m (Sprint) |
| Class | Maiden Plate (Fillies & Mares) |
| Surface | Soft |
| Rail | Not specified |
| Weather | Overcast |
| Field Size | 6 runners |
| Track Bias | Low draws favoured 1000m; barrier 1 problematic |
| Pace Scenario | MODERATE |

**Race Synopsis**: A competitive Maiden Plate for fillies and mares with several exposed runners who have shown ability without winning. The key dynamic is the soft track condition which may neutralise some of the usual inside rail advantage. Fiery Rose brings the most consistent form profile with three consecutive runner-up finishes and is primed to break through. The pace should be moderate with no confirmed leader, setting up for those with strong finishing speed.

---

## PACE MAP

```
LEADERS (1-2L):
  #4 Stoneywood - Will use gate speed from barrier 1
  #3 Rockabilly - Has shown early speed

PRESSING (2-4L):
  #6 Hurricane Power - Will push forward from inside draw

MIDFIELD (4-6L):
  #5 Fiery Rose <- SELECTION
  #7 Surreal Song - First-up, likely to settle

BACKMARKERS (6L+):
  #2 Kambati - Showed no early speed on debut
```

**Pace Analysis**: With no confirmed frontrunner, Stoneywood from barrier 1 may be forced to show speed early to avoid being trapped on the fence. Rockabilly has shown some early pace in previous starts. The lack of a genuine speed-on runner suggests a moderate tempo, which could suit horses with strong finishing kicks. Fiery Rose has consistently finished her races strongly and should benefit from a genuine tempo scenario.

## CONTENDER ANALYSIS

### #5 FIERY ROSE [4 stars]
**Three-time runner-up bursting to win - overdue maiden**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 9/10 | 2-2-2 - Consistently competitive at this level |
| Class | 8/10 | Well exposed to this grade |
| Distance | 8/10 | Won trial at this trip, proven 1000-1160m |
| Track/Condition | 7/10 | Good record at Turffontein, soft query |
| Barrier/Map | 7/10 | Barrier 5 allows options, can settle midfield |
| Connections | 6/10 | Mark Khan steady trainer, Penny competent |
| Fitness/Prep | 6/10 | 197 days since last run - main concern |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.5/10** | |

**Form String**: 2-2-2

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 28/06/25 | Turffontein | 1160m | 2nd | 2.75L | 54.5kg | - | Chased home Titan Of The Turf |
| 08/06/25 | Turffontein | 1000m | 2nd | 1L | 60kg | - | Narrowly beaten by Queen's Pact |
| 17/05/25 | Turffontein | 1160m | 2nd | 2.25L | 60kg | - | Outfinished by Limerick Lace |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 42%
- Market Implied: 40%
- Fair Odds: $2.38
- Current Odds: $2.50 (estimated)
- Edge: +5%
- Value: YES

**Strengths:**
- Most consistent form profile - 3 consecutive seconds
- Proven at Turffontein over this distance
- Filly allowance (2.5kg less than males)
- Form guide explicitly states "bursting to win"

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Long 197-day layoff since last start
- No soft track form on record
- Only placed behind better horses - are these weaker?
- First-up after spell without recorded trial

**Verdict**: The most consistent runner in the field with three runner-up finishes at this level. While the long spell is a concern, the fact she returns to the same course and distance where she ran second (1L) previously is encouraging. The filly allowance gives her a weight edge and she represents the clear value play if odds hold above $2.40.

### #3 ROCKABILLY [3 stars]
**Champion jockey aboard but disappointing as favourite last start**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 6/10 | 3rd last start after runner-up finish |
| Class | 7/10 | Competitive at this level |
| Distance | 8/10 | Both runs at 1000m - suited |
| Track/Condition | 6/10 | Runs on Soft for first time |
| Barrier/Map | 5/10 | Barrier 6 - widest, challenging |
| Connections | 9/10 | Gavin Lerena (24.8% SR) - major positive |
| Fitness/Prep | 8/10 | Second-up, 49 days spacing - ideal |
| **Weighted Total** | **6.8/10** | |

**Form String**: 2-3

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 23/11/25 | Vaal | 1000m | 3rd | 4.9L | 59kg | - | Sent out $1.63 favourite, disappointing |
| 04/11/25 | Vaal | 1000m | 2nd | 2L | 57.5kg | - | Promising debut behind Queensland |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 35%
- Market Implied: 45%
- Fair Odds: $2.86
- Current Odds: $2.20 (estimated)
- Edge: -23%
- Value: NO

**Strengths:**
- SA Champion Jockey Gavin Lerena engaged (24.8% strike rate)
- Ideal second-up pattern after 49-day break
- Form guide states "Close to a maiden win"
- Progressive 3yo with upside

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Disappointing as $1.63 favourite last start (4.9L third)
- Widest barrier 6 - difficult in small field
- Untested on soft ground
- 60kg top weight is maximum impost

**Verdict**: The likely market favourite given the champion jockey booking, but the value equation doesn't stack up. His last start as $1.63 favourite yielding only third (4.9L) raises questions about his competitiveness. Barrier 6 is problematic in a 6-horse field where he'll have to do work to cross. Respected for place but represents an underlay for win betting.

### #4 STONEYWOOD [2 stars]
**Expert tip but barrier 1 a significant concern on the straight**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 7/10 | Strong second last start at this track/distance |
| Class | 7/10 | Well placed at this level |
| Distance | 8/10 | Good second over 1000m here |
| Track/Condition | 5/10 | First run on soft |
| Barrier/Map | 4/10 | Barrier 1 - concern down straight |
| Connections | 8/10 | Craig Zackey (G1 jockey) on board |
| Fitness/Prep | 8/10 | 12 days since solid second - ideal |
| **Weighted Total** | **6.5/10** | |

**Form String**: 9-2

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 30/12/25 | Turffontein | 1000m | 2nd | 1.2L | 60kg | - | Strong run, chased home Taking A Risk |
| 09/10/25 | Vaal | 1200m | 9th | 12.3L | 59kg | - | Well beaten on debut over unsuited trip |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 22%
- Market Implied: 29%
- Fair Odds: $4.55
- Current Odds: $3.50 (estimated)
- Edge: -23%
- Value: NO

**Strengths:**
- Expert tip as "banker" for Pick 6 Leg 1
- Fresh from strong second here 12 days ago
- Full-brother to smart galloper Dyce
- Grade 1 winning jockey Craig Zackey

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Barrier 1 - experts note "always a concern down Turffontein straight"
- 60kg top weight for maiden
- First run on soft ground
- Debut run 9th of 11 shows inconsistency

**Verdict**: Despite the expert tip as a potential banker, the barrier 1 draw is a genuine negative down the Turffontein straight where horses can get trapped on the rail. Craig Zackey is a capable jockey who won back-to-back G1s at this track in March 2025, but the barrier concern and soft ground unknown limit appeal. Include for exotics but don't rely on for win bet.

### #6 HURRICANE POWER [1 star]
**Apprentice aboard, form has waned significantly**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 3/10 | 12th last start, well beaten |
| Class | 5/10 | Shown glimmer at this level (3rd) |
| Distance | 6/10 | Best run was over 1000m |
| Track/Condition | 6/10 | Has run on soft before (3rd) |
| Barrier/Map | 7/10 | Barrier 2 - good position |
| Connections | 5/10 | Apprentice Savanna Valjalo - claim helps |
| Fitness/Prep | 5/10 | 24 days since poor effort |
| **Weighted Total** | **5.0/10** | |

**Form String**: 12-3

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 8%
- Market Implied: 10%
- Fair Odds: $12.50
- Current Odds: ~$10.00
- Edge: -20%
- Value: NO

**Verdict**: The only soft track form in the field (3rd on soft) is a minor positive, but 7 starts without winning and a recent 12th of 12 (14.5L) suggests she's regressing. Not a genuine winning chance.

---

### #7 SURREAL SONG [1 star]
**Resuming after 197-day spell from moderate form**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 4/10 | Only start yielded 6th of 11 |
| Class | 5/10 | Lightly raced maiden |
| Distance | 5/10 | Only run was 1160m - drops in trip |
| Track/Condition | 5/10 | Unknown on soft |
| Barrier/Map | 6/10 | Barrier 4 - acceptable |
| Connections | 5/10 | Lesser profile trainer |
| Fitness/Prep | 4/10 | 197 days without public trial |
| **Weighted Total** | **4.8/10** | |

**Form String**: 6

**Verdict**: First-up after a long spell with only a moderate debut to her name. No trial form available. Hard to support despite form guide optimism.

---

### #2 KAMBATI [1 star]
**Long-shot on debut form - not competitive**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 2/10 | 6th of 12 on debut at $126 |
| Class | 4/10 | Hasn't shown ability |
| Distance | 5/10 | Drops from 1200m to 1000m |
| Track/Condition | 4/10 | Unknown on soft |
| Barrier/Map | 6/10 | Barrier 3 - fine |
| Connections | 4/10 | Lesser profile stable |
| Fitness/Prep | 5/10 | 22 days since debut - fine |
| **Weighted Total** | **4.0/10** | |

**Form String**: 6

**Verdict**: 4yo gelding who was sent out at $126 on debut and finished 8.25L away. Form guide notes "Cannot enthuse." No interest.

### Other Runners

| # | Horse | Odds | True % | Value | Grade | Key Factor |
|---|-------|------|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| 2 | Kambati | ~$50 | 2% | N | X | Moderate debut, $126 chance |
| 6 | Hurricane Power | ~$10 | 8% | N | C | Soft track form only positive |
| 7 | Surreal Song | ~$12 | 8% | N | C | Resuming, limited data |

---

## MARKET ANALYSIS

| Horse | Expected | Assessment |
|-------|----------|------------|
| #3 Rockabilly | ~$2.20 | Market leader on jockey strength - underlay |
| #5 Fiery Rose | ~$2.50 | Value play - consistent form overlaid |
| #4 Stoneywood | ~$3.50 | Expert tip but barrier concern limits |
| #6 Hurricane Power | ~$10.00 | Drifting on recent form |
| #7 Surreal Song | ~$12.00 | Resuming unknown |
| #2 Kambati | ~$50.00 | No interest |

**Market Intelligence**: Rockabilly will attract heavy support due to Gavin Lerena's booking (SA Champion Jockey). This creates value on Fiery Rose who is the most consistent runner but may drift due to the 197-day absence. Stoneywood has expert backing but barrier 1 should cause some drift.

---

## EXPERT CONSENSUS

| Source | Selection | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Form-guide.com.au | #5 Fiery Rose | "Runner-up all three to date, bursting to win" |
| Racing Tips SA | #4 Stoneywood | "Full-brother to Dyce, could be a banker" |
| Form-guide.com.au | #3 Rockabilly | "Close to maiden win, leading rider aboard" |

**Consensus**: Two sources favour the consistent Fiery Rose, while Stoneywood is highlighted for breeding and recent form. The jockey booking on Rockabilly will make him popular. Our selection on Fiery Rose aligns with the form expert view while the value equation is more favourable.

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Key Risks:**
1. Fiery Rose 197-day spell - longest absence of main contenders
2. Soft track condition - limited soft track form across field
3. Barrier 1 for Stoneywood - could trap on fence down straight
4. Pace uncertainty - no confirmed leader in small field

**Watch Factors:**
- How Stoneywood handles barrier 1 early
- Fiery Rose's condition after long spell (paddock assessment)
- Track deterioration through earlier races

**Scenarios:**
- Best case: Genuine pace, Fiery Rose settles midfield and finishes over the top
- Worst case: Slow tempo, leaders get cheap lead, Fiery Rose gives them too much start
- Most likely: Moderate tempo, Rockabilly and Stoneywood duel, Fiery Rose swoops late

## BETTING STRATEGY

### Primary Selection
**#5 FIERY ROSE - WIN @ $2.50+**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | 4 stars |
| True Probability | 42% |
| Fair Odds | $2.38 |
| Current Odds | $2.50 (est) |
| Edge | +5% |
| Stake | 2.0 units |

**Rationale**: Three consecutive runner-up finishes at this level demonstrate she is ready to break through. Returns to the track and distance where she ran second (1L) previously. The long spell is a concern but the value equation at $2.50+ is attractive. The filly allowance gives her 2.5kg on the males.

### Secondary Selection
**#3 ROCKABILLY - PLACE ONLY @ $1.40+**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | 3 stars |
| True Probability | 35% win / 65% place |
| Stake | 1.0 units |

**Rationale**: Champion jockey booking ensures he'll be prominent but disappointed as short favourite last start. Wide barrier 6 is a negative. Too short for win betting but should place.

### Exotic Strategy

**Quinella**: 5/3
- Rationale: The two most likely placegetters based on form

**Trifecta**: 5 -> 3,4 -> 3,4,6
- Rationale: Fiery Rose on top, with Rockabilly and Stoneywood fighting for minor positions

**First Four**: 5/3/4/6
- Rationale: Box the top four - small field limits combinations

---

## FINAL SUMMARY

| Bet | Selection | Odds | Stake | Confidence |
|-----|-----------|------|-------|------------|
| WIN | #5 Fiery Rose | $2.50+ | 2.0u | 4 stars |
| PLACE | #3 Rockabilly | $1.40+ | 1.0u | 3 stars |
| QNL | 5/3 | ~$3.00 | 1.0u | 3 stars |
| TRI | 5 -> 3,4 -> 3,4,6 | ~$15 | 0.5u | 3 stars |

**Overall Confidence**: 4 stars

**Key Takeaway**: Fiery Rose is the clear value play in a competitive Maiden Plate. Her three consecutive runner-up finishes indicate she is overdue and returns to a suitable track and distance. The 197-day absence is the main query but the price compensates. Rockabilly will be popular on jockey but represents an underlay for win betting.
