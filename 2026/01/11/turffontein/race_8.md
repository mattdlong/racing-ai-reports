# Turffontein Race 8 - Betway Got The Greenlight Stakes (1400m)
**Sunday 11 January 2026 | 9:10 PM SAST | Grade 3 | 3YO Only**

---

## RACE OVERVIEW

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Track | Turffontein Standside (Gauteng) |
| Distance | 1400m |
| Class | Grade 3 |
| Surface | Soft |
| Rail | True |
| Weather | Overcast |
| Field Size | 9 runners |
| Track Bias | Inside runners favoured on soft ground |
| Pace Scenario | MODERATE |

**Race Synopsis**: This Grade 3 feature for 3-year-olds is a key lead-up to the Gauteng Triple Crown series. Trust carries a 2kg penalty as winner of the Grade 2 Dingaans but has the class edge over a field that includes progressive types One Eye On Vegas and Wayne. With Trust drawn inside at barrier 1, and the pace likely to be moderate with only a couple of confirmed on-pace runners, this race sets up ideally for the favourite to dictate terms. The soft track should suit Trust who has won on yielding ground previously.

---

## PACE MAP

```
LEADERS (1-2L):
  #3 Trust - Can lead or press, ideally drawn
  #4 One Eye On Vegas - Forward runner, barrier 4

PRESSING (2-4L):
  #1 Shadowfax - On-pace type
  #2 Charming Cheetah - Tactical speed

MIDFIELD (4-6L):
  #5 Agoge - Stalker
  #6 Golden Warrior - Midfield runner
  #8 Splittheeights - First run at trip, likely midfield

BACKMARKERS (6L+):
  #7 Wayne - Comes from back <- DANGER
  #9 Yippee Kiyay - Back runner
```

**Pace Analysis**: Moderate tempo expected. Trust is ideally drawn to find the rail and either lead or sit one-out-one-back. One Eye On Vegas from barrier 4 will look to be handy. With only two genuine on-pace runners, the race shape favours those racing within 3L of the lead. Wayne will need luck from the wide draw but has strong closing speed. Splittheeights steps up in trip and may be grinding on late.

## CONTENDER ANALYSIS

### #3 TRUST [4 stars]
**Smart G2 winner with class edge over this field**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 9/10 | Won G2 Dingaans in style, 2nd G3 at this trip |
| Class | 9/10 | Proven at G2 level, clearly best credentials |
| Distance | 8/10 | Has won 1600m, placed at 1400m in G3 |
| Track/Condition | 8/10 | Track 2:1-1-0, soft track 2:1-1-0 |
| Barrier/Map | 9/10 | Barrier 1 - ideal for rail position |
| Connections | 8/10 | Munger in good form, Dawson progressive |
| Fitness/Prep | 8/10 | 43 days since G2 win - fit enough |
| **Weighted Total** | **8.5/10** | |

**Form String**: 121

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 29/11 | Turffontein | 1600m | 1st | 0.7L | 60kg | S Moodley | Won G2 Dingaans comfortably |
| 01/11 | Turffontein | 1400m | 2nd | 0.6L | 58kg | S Moodley | Beaten by Tin Pan Alley in G3 |
| 06/09 | Turffontein | 1200m | 1st | 1.0L | 58kg | S Moodley | Maiden win, beat One Eye On Vegas |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 42%
- Market Implied: 45%
- Fair Odds: $2.38
- Current Odds: $2.20
- Edge: +8%
- Value: YES (marginal)

**Strengths:**
- Best form credentials in field (G2 winner)
- Ideal draw at barrier 1 on soft track
- Course specialist (2:1-1-0 at Turffontein)
- Beat today's rival One Eye On Vegas on debut

**Vulnerabilities:**
- 2kg weight penalty versus rest of field
- 43-day break could see some freshness issues
- Jockey change from S Moodley to R Munger

**Verdict**: Trust is the clear class runner. His G2 Dingaans win was dominant, beating subsequent performers. The 2kg penalty is justified but shouldn't stop him in this company. Barrier 1 is a significant advantage on soft ground where the rail is traditionally favoured. Expect Trust to settle handy and kick clear in the straight. Hard to beat.

---

### #4 ONE EYE ON VEGAS [4 stars]
**Progressive C&D winner, main danger to Trust**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 8/10 | Won last impressively by 3.3L |
| Class | 7/10 | Untested at G3 but beat maiden/plate |
| Distance | 9/10 | Both wins at 1400m - ideal trip |
| Track/Condition | 8/10 | Course winner, handles conditions |
| Barrier/Map | 7/10 | Barrier 4 - workable |
| Connections | 8/10 | C Murray in form, Tarry powerful yard |
| Fitness/Prep | 8/10 | 26 days since last - good spacing |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.8/10** | |

**Form String**: 1x231

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 16/12 | Turffontein | 1400m | 1st | 3.3L | 56kg | C Murray | Dominant plate win |
| 29/11 | Turffontein | 1400m | 2nd | 1.4L | 53kg | C Murray | Good effort in G3 |
| 15/11 | Turffontein | 1160m | 3rd | 1.8L | 55kg | C Murray | Solid effort |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 25%
- Market Implied: 29%
- Fair Odds: $4.00
- Current Odds: $3.50
- Edge: +14%
- Value: YES

**Strengths:**
- Course and distance winner (1400m perfect)
- Progressive profile with improvement each start
- Callan Murray retains ride - good rapport
- 2kg better off with Trust than last meeting

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Class rise to G3 first time
- Was beaten by Trust on debut
- May need to improve another length or two

**Verdict**: One Eye On Vegas looks the clear second-best. The 3.3L demolition last start was eye-catching and both career wins have been at this trip. Gets 2kg from Trust now and should run very close. The main query is whether the class rise is too much, but this is a weak G3 field and he rates the chief danger.

---

### #7 WAYNE [3 stars]
**Unbeaten at trip, live outsider with query on draw**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 8/10 | Won last two at this trip |
| Class | 6/10 | Unproven beyond GPLATE level |
| Distance | 9/10 | Unbeaten in two at 1400m |
| Track/Condition | 7/10 | No Turffontein form, handles soft |
| Barrier/Map | 5/10 | Barrier 7 - needs luck |
| Connections | 7/10 | De Melo capable, Houdalakis progressive |
| Fitness/Prep | 8/10 | Back-to-back wins, in form |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.1/10** | |

**Form String**: 113

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 07/12 | Vaal | 1400m | 1st | 0.3L | 60kg | C Murray | Won GPLATE narrowly |
| 06/11 | Turffontein | 1400m | 1st | 0.5L | 58kg | C Murray | First win at trip |
| 28/10 | Vaal | 1200m | 3rd | 0.5L | 57kg | C Murray | First up, solid |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 18%
- Market Implied: 20%
- Fair Odds: $5.56
- Current Odds: $5.00
- Edge: +11%
- Value: YES

**Strengths:**
- Unbeaten at 1400m (2 from 2)
- Progressive form pattern
- Has been racing consistently well

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Barrier 7 difficult on soft track
- Massive class rise from GPLATE to G3
- Needs everything to go right

**Verdict**: Wayne has been progressive and seems to stay 1400m well based on two wins at the trip. The concern is the draw - barrier 7 means he'll likely settle back and come wide. If the track plays fair he's a genuine each-way chance, but the wide draw knocks his winning chances.

---

### #8 SPLITTHEEIGHTS [2 stars]
**First run at 1400m, needs further to show best**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 6/10 | Not disgraced in G1 |
| Class | 7/10 | G3 placed, some black type |
| Distance | 5/10 | First try at 1400m - query |
| Track/Condition | 7/10 | Course placegetter |
| Barrier/Map | 6/10 | Barrier 8 - average |
| Connections | 8/10 | De Kock stable, Danielson capable |
| Fitness/Prep | 7/10 | First up since G1 - risky |
| **Weighted Total** | **6.5/10** | |

**Verdict**: Splittheeights has talent but stepping to 1400m for the first time is a concern. The breeding suggests he may get it but it's unproven. At the odds, happy to watch.

### Other Runners

| # | Horse | Odds | True % | Value | Grade | Key Factor |
|---|-------|------|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Shadowfax | $10.00 | 8% | N | B | Needs to improve several lengths |
| 2 | Charming Cheetah | $12.00 | 7% | N | B | Inconsistent, wrong end of form |
| 5 | Agoge | $8.00 | 10% | N | B | Lightly raced, may be outclassed |
| 6 | Golden Warrior | $15.00 | 5% | N | C | Below G3 level |
| 9 | Yippee Kiyay | $12.00 | 7% | N | B | Better sprinting, query trip |

---

## MARKET ANALYSIS

| Horse | Open | Current | Move | Assessment |
|-------|------|---------|------|------------|
| #3 Trust | $2.00 | $2.20 | Drifted | Slight drift - not concerning |
| #4 One Eye On Vegas | $4.00 | $3.50 | Firmed | Money for chief danger |
| #7 Wayne | $6.00 | $5.00 | Firmed | Support from connections |
| #8 Splittheeights | $8.00 | $8.00 | Steady | No move |

**Market Intelligence**: Trust has drifted marginally from $2.00 to $2.20 which creates value. One Eye On Vegas is the best-backed runner in the race, firming from $4.00 to $3.50. Wayne has also attracted support. The market suggests a two-horse race between Trust and One Eye On Vegas with Wayne the best of the rest.

---

## EXPERT CONSENSUS

| Source | Selection | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Gold Circle (Thiselton) | #3 Trust | "Hard to go past Trust - G2 winner should prove too classy" |
| TABGold | #3 Trust | "Has to give 2kg but that should not stop him" |
| Form-Guide Preview | #3 Trust | "Smart colt too good in G2 company" |

**Consensus**: Universal support for Trust. Experts acknowledge the weight penalty but believe the class edge is decisive. One Eye On Vegas mentioned as chief danger by all. Wayne noted as progressive but with query on draw.

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Key Risks:**
1. Trust may be vulnerable first-up on 43-day break
2. Soft track may deteriorate further - inside bias could help or hurt depending on where Trust settles
3. One Eye On Vegas is rapidly improving and gets weight swing

**Watch Factors:**
- Trust's early position - needs to find the rail
- Track bias from earlier races
- How Wayne travels from wide draw

**Scenarios:**
- Best case: Trust leads or sits 2nd, kicks clear final 200m
- Worst case: Trust misses the kick, gets trapped wide
- Most likely: Trust settles handy, One Eye On Vegas chases, Wayne runs on for 3rd

## BETTING STRATEGY

### Primary Selection
**#3 Trust - WIN @ $2.20+**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | 4 stars |
| True Probability | 42% |
| Fair Odds | $2.38 |
| Current Odds | $2.20 |
| Edge | +8% |
| Stake | 2.0 units |

**Rationale**: Trust is the class runner carrying a justified weight penalty. The inside draw, soft track bias, and moderate expected tempo all play into his racing pattern. While $2.20 is around fair value, the combination of form, draw, and conditions makes this a solid play.

### Secondary Selection
**#4 One Eye On Vegas - EACH WAY @ $3.50+**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | 4 stars |
| True Probability | 25% |
| Fair Odds | $4.00 |
| Current Odds | $3.50 |
| Edge | +14% |
| Stake | 1.5 units (0.75 Win / 0.75 Place) |

**Rationale**: Progressive type whose form is trending sharply upward. The 3.3L last-start win was dominant and both career wins have been at this trip. Gets 2kg from Trust and looks overpriced at $3.50 given the genuine winning chance.

### Value Play
**#7 Wayne - EACH WAY @ $5.00+**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | 3 stars |
| True Probability | 18% |
| Fair Odds | $5.56 |
| Current Odds | $5.00 |
| Edge | +11% |
| Stake | 1.0 units (0.5 Win / 0.5 Place) |

**Rationale**: Unbeaten at 1400m and progressive. The barrier is a concern but if he gets luck in running, he has the ability to be competitive. Represents value at $5.00+ for minors.

### Exotic Strategy

**Quinella**: 3/4
- Rationale: Trust and One Eye On Vegas clearly superior to rest

**Trifecta**: 3/4 -> 3,4,7 -> 3,4,7,8
- Rationale: Trust and One Eye On Vegas to fill first two, Wayne and Splittheeights for minors

**First Four**: 3/4/7,8/field
- Rationale: Two standouts, Wayne and Splittheeights for third, open fourth

---

## FINAL SUMMARY

| Bet | Selection | Odds | Stake | Confidence |
|-----|-----------|------|-------|------------|
| WIN | #3 Trust | $2.20+ | 2.0u | 4 stars |
| E/W | #4 One Eye On Vegas | $3.50+ | 1.5u | 4 stars |
| E/W | #7 Wayne | $5.00+ | 1.0u | 3 stars |
| QNL | 3/4 | ~$4.00 | 1.0u | 4 stars |

**Overall Confidence**: 4 stars

**Key Takeaway**: Trust is the standout but One Eye On Vegas is closing the gap rapidly. The Quinella looks the safest exotic play with Trust and One Eye On Vegas clearly superior to the rest. Wayne offers each-way value if the draw doesn't prove fatal.
