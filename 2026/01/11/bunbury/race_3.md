# Bunbury Race 3 - Wittens Irrigation & Design Mdn (1200m)
**Sunday 11 January 2026 | 7:20 AM | 3yo Maiden | $25,000**

---

## RACE OVERVIEW

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Track | Bunbury (WA) |
| Distance | 1200m |
| Class | 3yo Maiden |
| Surface | Good 4 |
| Rail | True Position |
| Weather | Fine, 24°C |
| Field Size | 12 runners |
| Track Bias | Neutral, no bias expected |
| Pace Scenario | MODERATE - contested early |

**Race Synopsis**: A maiden for 3-year-olds over the sprint distance of 1200m. This field presents a mix of trialling first-starters and lightly-raced gallopers looking to break through. The presence of several well-trialled debutants creates uncertainty, but the experienced runners who have shown form at this level should prove too strong. Moderate pace expected with multiple horses wanting forward positions.

---

## PACE MAP

```
LEADERS (1-2L):
  #7 Watto's Mark - proven trial winner
  #6 Mind Field - strong trialler

PRESSING (2-4L):
  #1 Two Time Charlie - needs to settle better
  #9 Coracao - resuming, may roll forward

MIDFIELD (4-6L):
  #2 Buster Biff ← SELECTION
  #8 Daisiesfortheladys

BACKMARKERS (6L+):
  #3 Safedeel - likely to trail
  #10 Maritime Dream
```

**Pace Analysis**: Moderate tempo anticipated with WATTO'S MARK and MIND FIELD likely to dispute early leadership. The presence of multiple first-starters creates some uncertainty in pace projections, but the more experienced runners should settle into predictable patterns. The 1200m at Bunbury favours on-pace runners, so those settling midfield with the ability to quicken late will be advantaged.

## CONTENDER ANALYSIS

### #7 WATTO'S MARK ★★★★☆
**Impressive trial winner with natural early speed - top selection**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 9/10 | Won trial by 3.7L at Belmont |
| Class | 8/10 | Debut but strong pedigree |
| Distance | 8/10 | Bred to handle 1200m well |
| Track/Condition | 8/10 | Should handle Good 4 |
| Barrier/Map | 8/10 | Gate 6 allows tactical options |
| Connections | 8/10 | Mack Hall/Keshaw Dhurun solid combo |
| Fitness/Prep | 8/10 | Three trials, last win impressive |
| **Weighted Total** | **8.1/10** | |

**Form String**: Debut

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 22/12 | Belmont | 1000m | 1/9 | 3.7L | 51kg | K Dhurun | Effortless trial winner |
| 28/07 | Lark Hill | 1000m | 2/9 | 2.31L | 54kg | H Watson | Strong second in trial |
| 14/07 | Lark Hill | 400m | 2/7 | 0.28L | 54kg | H Watson | Close second over sprint |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 35%
- Market Implied: 22%
- Fair Odds: $2.86
- Current Odds: $3.50
- Edge: +18%
- Value: YES

**Strengths:**
- Dominated last trial with authoritative 3.7-length victory
- Natural early speed suits Bunbury's front-running bias
- Supido progeny known for early speed and precocity
- Consistent improvement through trial progression

**Vulnerabilities:**
- First-up syndrome on debut
- Gate 6 requires tactical nous from jockey
- Stepping up from 1000m trials to 1200m

**Verdict**: The most impressive trialler in the field with a devastating 3.7-length trial victory at Belmont. The Supido gelding has shown natural early speed and the ability to sustain it, which is ideal for Bunbury's configuration. While debut nerves are a concern, his trial form suggests he's ready to fire first-up.

### #2 BUSTER BIFF ★★★☆☆
**Second-up improver with solid trial foundation**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 7/10 | Won trial, bombed start last start |
| Class | 6/10 | Maidens only, limited exposed form |
| Distance | 7/10 | 1200m suits better than 1000m debut |
| Track/Condition | 7/10 | Previous run at track, Good 4 suitable |
| Barrier/Map | 5/10 | Barrier 9 is wide, needs luck |
| Connections | 7/10 | Harrison/Carbery capable combination |
| Fitness/Prep | 8/10 | Second-up, won trial in between |
| **Weighted Total** | **6.6/10** | |

**Form String**: 10-1-10

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 26/12 | Pinjarra | 1200m | 10/14 | 4.3L | 56.5kg | P Carbery | Bombed start, wide trip |
| 15/12 | Lark Hill | 950m | 1/9 | 0.17L | 49kg | P Carbery | Trial winner, sharp improvement |
| 11/06 | Bunbury | 1000m | 10/12 | 7.6L | 57kg | C Johnston-Porter | Poor debut at this track |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 22%
- Market Implied: 15%
- Fair Odds: $4.55
- Current Odds: $5.50
- Edge: +17%
- Value: YES

**Strengths:**
- Won trial easily by narrow margin, showing sharp improvement
- Jimmy Choux progeny often improve significantly second-up
- Track familiarity from previous start here
- Bombed start last time explains poor performance

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Wide barrier draw compounds starting issues
- Poor track record at Bunbury (10th on debut here)
- Needs to overcome starting gate demons
- Limited class exposed to date

**Verdict**: The trial victory and excuse of a poor start last time make this gelding appealing at odds. Jimmy Choux progeny are notorious improvers and the step up to 1200m should suit better. Barrier 9 is a concern but if he begins cleanly, expect significant improvement.

---

### #6 MIND FIELD ★★★☆☆
**Well-trialled first-starter with strong recent form**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 8/10 | Won latest trial impressively |
| Class | 7/10 | Untested but Deep Field breeding |
| Distance | 7/10 | Breeding suggests 1200m suitable |
| Track/Condition | 7/10 | Should handle conditions |
| Barrier/Map | 7/10 | Barrier 3 gives tactical options |
| Connections | 6/10 | Ryan Hill/Victoria Corver combination |
| Fitness/Prep | 8/10 | Five trials, won most recent |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.1/10** | |

**Form String**: Debut

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 29/12 | Lark Hill | 950m | 1/9 | 0.77L | 50kg | V Corver | Latest trial winner |
| 15/12 | Lark Hill | 400m | 2/9 | 0.06L | 53kg | J Azzopardi | Very close second |
| 28/07 | Lark Hill | 1000m | 7/9 | 2.59L | 56.5kg | B Parnham | Midfield in earlier trial |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 18%
- Market Implied: 25%
- Fair Odds: $5.56
- Current Odds: $4.00
- Edge: -28%
- Value: NO

**Strengths:**
- Deep Field progeny with good early speed
- Five trials provide excellent foundation
- Won latest trial against handy opposition
- Well-drawn to take advantage of early speed

**Vulnerabilities:**
- First-up debutant facing experienced runners
- Market confidence may be overblown
- Beautiful Mind dam line not renowned for early success
- Trainer has limited record with debutants

**Verdict**: While the trial form is impressive, the market has shortened this horse beyond what the form suggests. Deep Field progeny can be precocious but facing experienced maidens first-up is a significant test. Prefer others at current odds.

### #1 TWO TIME CHARLIE ★★☆☆☆
**Resuming with class drop but form queries remain**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 5/10 | Poor debut in stronger company |
| Class | 7/10 | Dropping significantly in grade |
| Distance | 7/10 | 1200m should be ideal trip |
| Track/Condition | 6/10 | No track experience |
| Barrier/Map | 6/10 | Barrier 2 allows forward position |
| Connections | 7/10 | New trainer Stephen Miller |
| Fitness/Prep | 6/10 | Fresh but solid trial base |
| **Weighted Total** | **6.3/10** | |

**Form String**: 6

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 23/08 | Belmont | 1200m | 6/8 | 8.7L | 56kg | N Faithfull | Well beaten in stronger race |
| 29/12 | Lark Hill | 950m | 3/9 | 1.77L | 57kg | J Gray | Solid trial placing |
| 11/08 | Lark Hill | 950m | 2/6 | 0.32L | 52kg | C Parnham | Close second in trial |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 15%
- Market Implied: 12%
- Fair Odds: $6.67
- Current Odds: $8.00
- Edge: +17%
- Value: MARGINAL

**Strengths:**
- Significant class drop from debut conditions
- Playing God progeny often improve with experience
- New stable may have found improvement
- Trial form suggests fitness is on track

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Debut was thoroughly disappointing
- No improvement shown in trials since return
- Unknown quantity with new connections
- Distance may stretch stamina reserves

**Verdict**: The significant drop in class makes this gelding worth considering, but the debut form was poor enough to suggest fundamental issues. Trial form has been solid without being spectacular. Each-way chance at best.

---

### #9 CORACAO ★★☆☆☆
**Second-up filly with solid fresh form**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 7/10 | Encouraging fresh run |
| Class | 6/10 | Limited class ceiling shown |
| Distance | 7/10 | 1200m within range |
| Track/Condition | 8/10 | Good track/condition record |
| Barrier/Map | 6/10 | Barrier 7 workable |
| Connections | 6/10 | Scallan/Faithfull combination |
| Fitness/Prep | 7/10 | Second-up, should improve |
| **Weighted Total** | **6.7/10** | |

**Form String**: 6-8-6

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 18/12 | Bunbury | 1100m | 6/10 | 3.0L | 55kg | H Watson | Solid fresh effort |
| 02/08 | Pinjarra | 1200m | 8/8 | 8.2L | 55kg | L Campbell | Poor on Heavy track |
| 19/07 | Bunbury | 1000m | 6/11 | 3.8L | 54kg | L Campbell | Debut was respectable |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 12%
- Market Implied: 10%
- Fair Odds: $8.33
- Current Odds: $10.00
- Edge: +17%
- Value: MARGINAL

**Strengths:**
- Track winner Alebrije won that fresh run 
- Long Leaf progeny often improve second-up
- Handles Bunbury track configuration
- Drawn to get good run in transit

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Moderate ability ceiling based on form
- Heavy track disaster last preparation  
- Needs significant improvement to feature
- Racing against stronger opposition

**Verdict**: Honest filly who should run her race but appears outclassed in this field. The fresh run was solid but not good enough to suggest she can turn the tables on stronger opponents.

## MARKET ANALYSIS

| Horse | Open | Current | Move | Assessment |
|-------|------|---------|------|------------|
| #7 Watto's Mark | $4.00 | $3.50 | ↓ | Solid support, justified by trials |
| #6 Mind Field | $5.00 | $4.00 | ↓ | Heavy support, may be overs |
| #2 Buster Biff | $6.00 | $5.50 | → | Steady, appears value |
| #1 Two Time Charlie | $9.00 | $8.00 | ↓ | Mild support for class drop |

**Market Intelligence**: The market has identified the key players correctly with Watto's Mark leading the betting. Mind Field has attracted significant support which may have pushed him under his fair value, while Buster Biff appears overlooked despite strong trial form and legitimate excuses.

## EXPERT CONSENSUS

| Source | Selection | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Form Guide | Watto's Mark | Effortless trial winner |
| Local Knowledge | Mind Field | Strong trial form, good barrier |
| Track Bias | On-pace runners | 1200m suits forwardly placed |

**Consensus**: Strong support for the trial winners Watto's Mark and Mind Field, with most analysts noting the impressive nature of their recent work. The 1200m distance at Bunbury typically favours horses that can position close to the speed.

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Key Risks:**
1. First-starter syndrome affecting several key chances
2. Moderate pace may not suit closers
3. Track bias could emerge favoring inside runners

**Watch Factors:**
- Starting prices of the trial winners
- Gate speed of the debutants
- Jockey tactics from wide barriers

**Scenarios:**
- Best case: Watto's Mark leads and kicks clear in straight
- Worst case: Slow pace becomes sprint home, backmarkers swamp leaders
- Most likely: Moderate pace, on-pace runners fight out finish

## BETTING STRATEGY

### Primary Selection
**#7 Watto's Mark - WIN @ $3.50+**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | ★★★★☆ |
| True Probability | 35% |
| Fair Odds | $2.86 |
| Current Odds | $3.50 |
| Edge | +18% |
| Stake | 2.0 units |

**Rationale**: The trial form is outstanding and the natural early speed suits Bunbury perfectly. While first-up is a concern, the preparation has been thorough and the breeding suggests precocity.

### Secondary Selection
**#2 Buster Biff - E/W @ $5.50+**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | ★★★☆☆ |
| True Probability | 22% |
| Fair Odds | $4.55 |
| Current Odds | $5.50 |
| Edge | +17% |
| Stake | 1.5 units |

**Rationale**: The trial victory and valid excuse from last start make him underrated. Jimmy Choux progeny improve second-up and the 1200m should suit better than his previous shorter efforts.

### Exotic Strategy

**Quinella**: 7/2
- Rationale: Both horses offer value and have different race styles that complement

**Trifecta**: 7/2 → 1,6,9
- Rationale: Top two selections with logical third horses based on form

**First Four**: 7/2/1,6/9,3,4
- Rationale: Structured to capture value with main chances on top

---

## FINAL SUMMARY

| Bet | Selection | Odds | Stake | Confidence |
|-----|-----------|------|-------|------------|
| WIN | #7 Watto's Mark | $3.50+ | 2.0u | ★★★★☆ |
| E/W | #2 Buster Biff | $5.50+ | 1.5u | ★★★☆☆ |
| QNL | 7/2 | ~$10.00 | 1.0u | ★★★☆☆ |

**Overall Confidence**: ★★★★☆

**Key Takeaway**: This maiden features several promising types but Watto's Mark's trial dominance gives him a clear edge. The betting approach focuses on the trial form and class relief while avoiding overbet first-starters.
