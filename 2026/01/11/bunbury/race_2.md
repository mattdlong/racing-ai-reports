# Bunbury Race 2 - T.J. Depiazzi & Sons Maiden (1000m)
**Sunday January 11, 2026 | 1:50 PM | Maiden | $25,000**

---

## RACE OVERVIEW

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Track | Bunbury (WA) |
| Distance | 1000m |
| Class | Maiden |
| Surface | Good 4 |
| Rail | True position |
| Weather | Clear conditions |
| Field Size | 10 runners |
| Track Bias | No significant bias |
| Pace Scenario | MODERATE |

**Race Synopsis**: This appears a competitive maiden with several horses showing recent improvement. The form guide favours MYSTIC EMPRESS who charged home from last when resuming and draws much better this time. Second-up runners should be prominent with the fitness advantage over fresh horses in this field.

---

## PACE MAP

```
LEADERS (1-2L):
  #7 My Testimony - front runner

PRESSING (2-4L):
  #3 Media Mogul - prominent
  #4 God's Cross - forward

MIDFIELD (4-6L):
  #8 Mystic Empress ← SELECTION
  #5 Starchaser ← SELECTION

BACKMARKERS (6L+):
  #1 Le Beau
  #2 Earl It Is
```

**Pace Analysis**: Expecting a moderate tempo with MY TESTIMONY likely to lead from the rail. Limited early speed allows closers to position well, suiting the progressive types coming from behind.

## CONTENDER ANALYSIS

### #8 MYSTIC EMPRESS ★★★★☆
**Progressive filly showing excellent improvement pattern second-up**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 8/10 | Strong finish fresh from wide barrier |
| Class | 7/10 | Suited at maiden level |
| Distance | 8/10 | 1000m should suit speed |
| Track/Condition | 7/10 | Unraced at track but good conditions |
| Barrier/Map | 9/10 | Much better draw, can position closer |
| Connections | 7/10 | Lane/O'Donnell reliable |
| Fitness/Prep | 8/10 | Perfect second-up scenario |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.7/10** | |

**Form String**: 0x5

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 28/12 | Bunbury | 1100m | 5/12 | 2.3L | 54.5kg | C Parnham | Charged home from wide gate |
| 15/12 | Lark Hill | 950m | 2/9 | 0.17L | 50kg | J McNaught | Strong trial placing |
| 25/06 | Northam | 1100m | 13/14 | 14.5L | 55kg | A Hearn | Debut, well beaten |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 35%
- Market Implied: 31%
- Fair Odds: $2.86
- Current Odds: $3.20
- Edge: +11.9%
- Value: YES

**Strengths:**
- Strong late closing effort when resuming
- Much improved barrier draw (12 vs previous wide draws)
- Playing God filly with upside
- Ideal second-up pattern

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Still untested at track
- Drawn wide but manageable

**Verdict**: The form guide preview highlighting this filly as the standout selection carries significant weight. Her fresh run was full of promise, settling last from a wide gate before unleashing a powerful closing sectional to get within 2.3L. The barrier 6 draw represents a major tactical advantage over her previous wide gates. With natural improvement curve for a lightly-raced Playing God filly, she presents excellent value.

### #5 STARCHASER ★★★★☆
**Reliable campaigner with excellent fitness edge second-up**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 7/10 | Solid return, will improve |
| Class | 7/10 | Consistent at this level |
| Distance | 9/10 | Excellent at 1000m (2/2 placings) |
| Track/Condition | 6/10 | Mixed results at track |
| Barrier/Map | 6/10 | Workable position |
| Connections | 8/10 | Family affair, good record |
| Fitness/Prep | 9/10 | Perfect second-up spot |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.4/10** | |

**Form String**: 35472x4

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 28/12 | Bunbury | 1100m | 4/12 | 2.3L | 56kg | L Fiore | Solid return after 269 days |
| 15/12 | Lark Hill | 950m | 1/7 | 2.58L | 53kg | L Fiore | Won trial impressively |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 28%
- Market Implied: 22%
- Fair Odds: $3.57
- Current Odds: $4.50
- Edge: +26.1%
- Value: YES

**Strengths:**
- Perfect at this trip (placed 2/2 times)
- Strong trial winner before resuming
- Fitter for first-up run
- Excellent trainer/jockey combination

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Drawn barrier 9 in small field
- May need the run second-up

**Verdict**: Reliable performer who ran well fresh and trialed strongly. However, the market has potentially overrated his chances relative to horses with more upside like Mystic Empress. His consistency makes him better suited as a place-only proposition, where he offers reasonable value given his track record at this trip.

## MARKET ANALYSIS

| Horse | Open | Current | Move | Assessment |
|-------|------|---------|------|------------|
| #8 Mystic Empress | $3.50 | $3.20 | ↑ | Market confidence building |
| #5 Starchaser | $5.00 | $4.50 | ↑ | Slight support, value remains |
| #7 My Testimony | $6.00 | $7.00 | ↓ | Drifting despite rail draw |
| #3 Media Mogul | $4.50 | $5.50 | ↓ | Trial winner being overlooked |

**Market Intelligence**: MYSTIC EMPRESS has attracted steady support to become clear favourite, suggesting stable confidence. STARCHASER remains undervalued despite strong credentials.

---

## EXPERT CONSENSUS

| Source | Selection | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Form Guide | #8 Mystic Empress | Progressive galloper, better barrier |
| Local Expert | #5 Starchaser | Second-up, perfect distance record |
| Computer | #8 Mystic Empress | Form and class ratings favour |

**Consensus**: Strong support for MYSTIC EMPRESS as the horse to beat, with STARCHASER providing the main danger.

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Key Risks:**
1. MYSTIC EMPRESS may need more distance than 1000m
2. STARCHASER could be vulnerable fresh off long spell
3. MY TESTIMONY might steal breaks if uncontested lead

**Watch Factors:**
- Early pace development
- Position of MYSTIC EMPRESS at 600m mark
- Any track bias developing

**Scenarios:**
- Best case: MYSTIC EMPRESS settles 4th, strong home straight finish
- Worst case: Gets too far back and moderate pace doesn't suit
- Most likely: Positions well in running and proves too strong late

## BETTING STRATEGY

### Primary Selection
**#8 MYSTIC EMPRESS - WIN @ $4.50+**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | ★★★★☆ |
| True Probability | 28% |
| Fair Odds | $3.57 |
| Current Odds | $4.50 |
| Edge | +26% |
| Stake | 2.0 units |

**Rationale**: Form guide's standout selection with professional endorsement. The improved fresh run, perfect barrier draw, and natural progression curve for a lightly-raced Playing God filly offers excellent value at current odds. The 26% edge provides strong statistical backing for this selection.

### Secondary Selection  
**#5 STARCHASER - PLACE @ $2.40+**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Confidence | ★★☆☆☆ |
| True Probability | 52% |
| Fair Odds | $1.92 |
| Current Odds | $2.40 |
| Edge | +25% |
| Stake | 1.0 units |

**Rationale**: Reliable performer likely to run in the first three but lacks the upside to win at short odds. Place-only approach captures value in his most likely finishing position while avoiding the win risk.

### Exotic Strategy

**Quinella**: 8/5
- Rationale: Two strongest chances with different running patterns

**Trifecta**: 8/5 → 3,7
- Rationale: Top two selections over the other live chances

## FINAL SUMMARY

| Bet | Selection | Odds | Stake | Confidence |
|-----|-----------|------|-------|------------|
| WIN | #8 Mystic Empress | $4.50+ | 2.0u | ★★★★☆ |
| PLACE | #5 Starchaser | $2.40+ | 1.0u | ★★☆☆☆ |
| QNL | 8/5,3,7 | ~$12-18 | 1.0u | ★★★☆☆ |

**Overall Confidence**: ★★★★☆

**Key Takeaway**: Mystic Empress represents standout value based on her progressive profile and professional endorsement. The combination of improved fresh form, perfect barrier draw, and significant edge over market assessment makes her the clear betting focus in this maiden contest.
