# Bunbury Race 7 - Bunbury Cup On Sale Now Hcp (C3) (1400m)
**Saturday 11 January 2026 | 4:30 PM | Class 3 Handicap | $30,000**

---

## RACE OVERVIEW

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Track | Bunbury (WA) |
| Distance | 1400m |
| Class | Class 3 Handicap |
| Surface | Good 4 |
| Rail | True position |
| Weather | Fine |
| Field Size | 14 runners |
| Track Bias | No obvious bias |
| Pace Scenario | MODERATE |

**Race Synopsis**: Competitive Class 3 handicap with several horses stepping up in grade after recent wins. The moderate pace should suit horses with tactical speed who can position handy. Form guide expert commentary highlights IMAPAGETHREE GIRL (8) and THE SCHOLAR (6) as key chances, with both showing strong recent form patterns.

---

## PACE MAP

```
LEADERS (1-2L):
  #1 Seindeel - Regular leader returning from spell

PRESSING (2-4L):
  #3 Hez Got The Safe - Consistent on-pacer
  #8 Imapagethree Girl ← SELECTION

MIDFIELD (4-6L):
  #6 The Scholar ← SELECTION
  #9 Mangifera - Last start winner

BACKMARKERS (6L+):
  #11 Kings Sicario - Resuming after long break
```

**Pace Analysis**: Moderate tempo expected with Seindeel likely to set the pace from barrier 10. The honest pace should allow horses with tactical speed to position well, particularly favoring IMAPAGETHREE GIRL from her ideal barrier 2 draw.
