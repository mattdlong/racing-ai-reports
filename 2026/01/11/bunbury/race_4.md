# Bunbury Race 4 - Nixon Electrical Mdn (1400m)
**Saturday 11 January 2026 | 2:50 PM | MDN 3U | Prize TBC**

---

## RACE OVERVIEW

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Track | Bunbury (WA) |
| Distance | 1400m |
| Class | Maiden 3+ Years |
| Surface | Good 4 |
| Rail | True position |
| Weather | Fine |
| Field Size | 13 runners |
| Track Bias | No significant bias expected |
| Pace Scenario | MODERATE |

**Race Synopsis**: A competitive maiden for 3+ year-olds where form horses with recent improvement patterns are favoured. The step up to 1400m should suit several runners who have been racing shorter or getting home strongly over similar distances.

```

**Pace Analysis**: Moderate tempo expected with Spangledstar likely to lead from Maschino Moon. Several horses will look to settle handy, creating good tempo for on-pace runners and those with closing ability.

## MARKET ANALYSIS

| Horse | Open | Current | Move | Assessment |
|-------|------|---------|------|------------|
| #1 Magic Carats | $3.50 | $4.50 | ↑ | Overlay - market underrating consistency |
| #12 Autumn Gem | $4.00 | $5.50 | ↑ | Value available on strong return |
| #8 Spangledstar | $6.00 | $7.00 | ↑ | Support lacking |
