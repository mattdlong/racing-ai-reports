# Bunbury Race 1 - Own The Dream 2026 Mdn (2238m)
**Saturday January 11, 2026 | 1:20 PM | Maiden | $25,000**

---

## RACE OVERVIEW

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Track | Bunbury (WA) |
| Distance | 2238m |
| Class | Maiden |
| Surface | Good 4 |
| Rail | True position |
| Weather | Fine |
| Field Size | 9 runners |
| Track Bias | Neutral - no significant advantage |
| Pace Scenario | MODERATE - one clear leader expected |

**Race Synopsis**: Classic staying maiden over an extended trip where stamina and race experience will be at a premium. The distance will test these maidens, with settling ability and strong finishing sectionals crucial. Barrier draws less critical over the staying trip but rail position runners may have slight tactical advantage. Track conditions are optimal with no bias expected.

---

## PACE MAP

```
LEADERS (1-2L):
  #1 Crombie - Natural front runner

PRESSING (2-4L):
  #9 Dandy Flirt - Tactical speed, can press or settle
  #8 She's Resolute - Versatile runner

MIDFIELD (4-6L):
  #4 Major Magnus ← PLACE CHANCE
  #2 Obscentino

BACKMARKERS (6L+):
  #3 Ain'tnocureforlove
  #5 Willyabrup
  #6 Hero
  #7 Danea Rock
```

**Pace Analysis**: Moderate tempo expected with Crombie likely to lead uncontested. This should set up perfectly for horses with a finishing kick, particularly those who can track the speed and unleash late. The long straight at Bunbury will favor horses with sustained speed rather than explosive sprinters.

## CONTENDER ANALYSIS

### #9 DANDY FLIRT ★★★★☆
**Young filly with upside and perfect race positioning**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 8/10 | Strong runner-up last start, showing improvement |
| Class | 7/10 | Limited experience but handles maiden level well |
| Distance | 8/10 | Breeding suggests staying ability |
| Track/Condition | 7/10 | Good conditions suit |
| Barrier/Map | 8/10 | Perfect barrier for tactical options |
| Connections | 8/10 | Strong jockey/trainer combination |
| Fitness/Prep | 8/10 | Third-up, ideal race fitness |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.8/10** | |

**Form String**: 0-2-7

| Date | Track | Dist | Pos | Margin | Wt | Jockey | Key Point |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 28/12 | Bunbury | 2200m | 2nd | 0.6L | 54.5kg | S O'Donnell | Strong finishing effort |
| 11/12 | Pinjarra | 1500m | 7th | 6.2L | 54.5kg | L Campbell | Outclassed shorter trip |
| 30/11 | Pinjarra | 1300m | 12th | 8.5L | 54kg | L Campbell | Debut, needed experience |

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 32%
- Market Implied: 25%
- Fair Odds: $3.13
- Current Odds: $3.50
- Edge: +12%
- Value: YES

**Strengths:**
- Significant improvement from debut to second start
- Strong closing sectional last start over similar distance
- Perfect draw allows tactical flexibility
- Breeding suggests staying ability with God Has Spoken as sire

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Limited race experience (only 3 starts)
- Yet to win a race, pressure situation
- Stepping up slightly in trip

**Verdict**: The form guide assessment identifies her as the horse to beat, and the data supports this. Her runner-up effort over 2200m last start was impressive, finishing strongly behind Electric Bec. The step up to 2238m looks ideal and from barrier 4 she can track the speed and finish powerfully.

### #8 SHE'S RESOLUTE ★★★☆☆
**Consistent mare with strong recent form at the distance**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 7/10 | Solid third last start at distance |
| Class | 6/10 | Racing at right level |
| Distance | 9/10 | Proven at 2000m+ |
| Track/Condition | 7/10 | Good track record here |
| Barrier/Map | 6/10 | Barrier 8 workable over staying trip |
| Connections | 7/10 | Local trainer knows track well |
| Fitness/Prep | 7/10 | Well-placed fourth-up |
| **Weighted Total** | **7.0/10** | |

**Form String**: 3-10-5

**Probability Assessment:**
- True Win Probability: 22%
- Fair Odds: $4.55
- Current Odds: $5.00
- Edge: +10%
- Value: YES

**Strengths:**
- Proven at 2000m with solid third place
- Consistent performer with 3 placings from 17 starts
- Local connections understand track characteristics
- Handles good ground well

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Wide barrier draw (8) could prove costly
- Winless record suggests lacking killer instinct
- Stepping back up in grade after mixed form

**Verdict**: A genuine each-way proposition with proven staying ability. Her third place over 2000m at this track last start was encouraging and she should be competitive again.

---

### #4 MAJOR MAGNUS ★★☆☆☆
**Improving type who may find further progress over extended trip**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 6/10 | Third last start, finding line strongly |
| Class | 5/10 | Battling at this level |
| Distance | 7/10 | First time over distance but breeding suggests suitability |
| Track/Condition | 6/10 | Decent record at track |
| Barrier/Map | 7/10 | Good barrier for settling back |
| Connections | 6/10 | Trainer has limited record |
| Fitness/Prep | 6/10 | Adequate preparation |
| **Weighted Total** | **6.1/10** | |

**Verdict**: Place chance only. His third place last start was encouraging but the step up in distance is unknown.

---

### #1 CROMBIE ★★☆☆☆
**Veteran campaigner returning to his best distance**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Recent Form | 5/10 | Moderate recent efforts |
| Class | 6/10 | Proven at level in past |
| Distance | 8/10 | Best effort came over 2000m |
| Track/Condition | 6/10 | Track experience an advantage |
| Barrier/Map | 8/10 | Inside barrier perfect for leading role |
| Connections | 5/10 | Trainer strike rate modest |
| Fitness/Prep | 7/10 | Well-placed coming off freshen-up |
| **Weighted Total** | **6.4/10** | |

**Verdict**: Each-way chance if he can recapture his best form. Likely leader but may not have the class to hold on.

### Other Runners

| # | Horse | Odds | True % | Value | Grade | Key Factor |
|---|-------|------|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| 2 | Obscentino | $15.00 | 8% | N | C | Poor recent form |
| 3 | Ain'tnocureforlove | $41.00 | 3% | N | X | Winless from 22 starts |
| 5 | Willyabrup | $51.00 | 2% | N | X | Struggling at this level |

## MARKET ANALYSIS

| Horse | Open | Current | Move | Assessment |
|-------|------|---------|------|------------|
| #9 Dandy Flirt | $3.20 | $3.50 | ↑ | Drifting despite strong form - value |
| #8 She's Resolute | $4.50 | $5.00 | ↑ | Slight drift creates value |
| #1 Crombie | $6.00 | $5.50 | ↓ | Mild support for front runner |
| #4 Major Magnus | $8.00 | $9.00 | ↑ | Market lacks confidence |

**Market Intelligence**: The market has drifted on both our main selections, creating enhanced value. Dandy Flirt's drift appears unjustified given her strong last start effort. The lack of a dominant market favorite suggests an open contest where value can be found.

---

## EXPERT CONSENSUS

| Source | Selection | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Form Guide Summary | Dandy Flirt | "Has upside and gets chance to go one better" |
| Track Bias Analysis | No Strong Bias | "Distance nullifies barrier concerns" |
| Pace Analysis | Suits Closers | "Moderate tempo favors finishing horses" |

**Consensus**: Limited expert coverage available for provincial meeting, but form guide assessment aligns with our analysis supporting Dandy Flirt as the logical favorite.

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Key Risks:**
1. Extended distance may stretch some runners beyond their capability
2. Moderate pace could favor front runners if they get easy sectionals
3. Track conditions may change during the day affecting later races

**Watch Factors:**
- How Crombie travels in front - if he gets easy sections could prove hard to run down
- Dandy Flirt's barrier manners - needs clean getaway to execute tactical plan
- Weather conditions - any deterioration could impact track surface

**Scenarios:**
- Best case: Moderate pace allows Dandy Flirt to track speed and finish strongly
- Worst case: Slow tempo sees front runner steal a march
- Most likely: Honest pace with multiple chances in straight
