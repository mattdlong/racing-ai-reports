# Sha Tin Race 8 - The Racing Club Cup (1400m)
**Sunday January 11, 2026 | 3:05 PM | C2 Class | Firm Track**

---

## RACE OVERVIEW

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Track | Sha Tin (Hong Kong) |
| Distance | 1400m |
| Class | C2 Handicap |
| Surface | Firm |
| Rail | True position |
| Weather | Fine conditions |
| Field Size | 14 runners |
| Track Bias | No specific bias expected |
| Pace Scenario | MODERATE |

**Race Synopsis**: This C2 handicap over 1400m at Sha Tin presents a competitive field with several horses coming off strong recent form. The firm track conditions suit most runners, and the moderate pace scenario should allow versatile runners from various positions to be competitive. Key tactical advantage to those drawn closer to the rail on this right-handed track.

---

## PACE MAP

```
LEADERS (1-2L):
  #8 Little Paradise - Strong speed from barrier 4
  #9 Public Attention - Has shown early pace

PRESSING (2-4L):
  #6 Sky Trust - Likely to press forward
  #3 Invincible Shield - Usually races handily

MIDFIELD (4-6L):
  #5 Drombeg Banner ← SELECTION
  #4 Dancing Code

BACKMARKERS (6L+):
  #1 Beauty Eternal - Likely to settle back
  #13 Infinite Resolve - Usually comes from behind
```

**Pace Analysis**: Expecting a moderate tempo with Little Paradise and Public Attention likely to share the early pace. This should set up well for horses with turn-of-foot who can position midfield and finish strongly. Sky Trust from barrier 11 will need to work forward but has the class to overcome the wide draw.
