# Sha Tin Race 11 - Stanley Gap Handicap (1400m)
**Sunday 11 January 2026 | 4:50 PM | Class 3 | $0**

---

## RACE OVERVIEW

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Track | Sha Tin (Hong Kong) |
| Distance | 1400m |
| Class | Class 3 Handicap |
| Surface | Firm |
| Rail | True position |
| Weather | Fine |
| Field Size | 14 runners |
| Track Bias | Favors on-pace runners |
| Pace Scenario | MODERATE |

**Race Synopsis**: This Class 3 handicap presents as a moderate tempo affair with several horses capable of taking it up early. The firm track conditions and true rail position should favor horses positioned prominently throughout. The 1400m trip allows both on-pace runners and strong finishers to have their chance, but the likely moderate gallop may disadvantage backmarkers requiring a strong tempo.

---

## PACE MAP

```
LEADERS (1-2L):
  #2 Helene Supafeeling - proven leader
  #12 Mighty Steed - front-running style

PRESSING (2-4L):
  #1 Circuit Grand Slam
  #4 Master Of All

MIDFIELD (4-6L):
  #9 Tin Fook ← SELECTION
  #3 Akashvani

BACKMARKERS (6L+):
  #13 Lucky Sam Gor
  #14 Blazing Wukong
```

**Pace Analysis**: The race sets up with Helene Supafeeling and Mighty Steed likely to dispute the early lead, with Circuit Grand Slam and Master Of All pressing from handy positions. This moderate tempo should suit horses positioned within striking distance, while the genuine pace may stretch out the backmarkers who prefer stronger gallops.
