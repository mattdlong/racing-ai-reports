# Rosehill Race 8 - Kia Ora Bloodlines To Headlines (1300m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 4:40 PM | BM88 | 12 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Step Aside likely to control from barrier 8. On-pace runners favoured on the soft ground. Competitive BM88 with several resuming gallopers making race assessment tricky. Best value lies with place specialists at double-figure odds rather than underlaid favourites.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold. Step Aside (22%) closest but lacks expert support and is underlaid at $4.00. Band of Brothers has edge (+20%) but win probability (15%) too low for Best Bet designation.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#5 BAND OF BROTHERS - E/W @ $8.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A+B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 15% |
| Place Probability | 37.8% |
| Place Odds | $2.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +12.0% |
| Specialist Score | 1.98 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Qualifies via both Path A (Value Overlay: odds $8+, EW EV 12%+, place prob 38%) AND Path B (Place Specialist: score 1.98). Career 62.5% place rate (10/16) is exceptional. Inside barrier 1 critical at Rosehill where gates 1-6 account for 70% of winners. Matthew Dunn sends strong southern raider with 3kg claiming apprentice Jett Newman. Boxed on for 3rd at Eagle Farm last start (1400m Soft 5) - drops back to 1300m suits. Expert support: 50% (Kruzey best bet, 80% confidence).

## KEY RISKS

1. **Band of Brothers**: First run at metro Saturday level - step up in class from provincial/Eagle Farm
2. **Soft track deterioration**: Rain forecast could see track heavy by Race 8, impacting some runners
