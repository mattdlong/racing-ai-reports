# Rosehill Race 1 - Bisley Workwear Hcp (1100m)
**Saturday 17 January | 12:35 PM | Open 2Y HCP | 10 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with inside barriers advantaged at Rosehill. A tough 2YO debut race with limited exposed form - Thyme To Go has the best credentials after placing behind Magic Millions contender Knightsbridge. Market is tight and no clear value exists at current odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Favourite Thyme To Go meets the 25% win probability threshold but is too short in the market at $3.50 (fair odds $4.00). Edge is -12.5% which fails the +15% minimum. Also carries one red flag (rain query on soft ground as filly second-up) and only rates 3-star confidence given the limited 2YO form lines.

---

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**NO EW VALUE** - No runner meets the EW qualification criteria. Thyme To Go is too short ($3.50) for Path A requirements (minimum $6). The Freedman debutants (Written In Munny, Zambales, Outspan) show trial promise but lack the exposed form to justify EW value at current prices. Specialist scores are low across the field due to limited racing history.

## KEY RISKS

1. **2YO Debut Lottery** - Seven of ten runners are on debut with only trial form to assess. Hidden talent could emerge at value odds.
2. **Weather Impact** - Rain forecast could shift track to Soft 6/Heavy, changing the form picture entirely.
