# Rosehill Race 7 - Ranvet Handicap (2400m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 4:05 PM | BM78 | 15 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with multiple runners likely to settle midfield. Rail in true position favours on-pace types who can sustain a run. Open staying contest with no standout but genuine each-way value available at odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold. Wide-open staying contest with the market favourite (est. $5.00) showing -30% edge. Insufficient confidence for Best Bet designation.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#10 KUREDER (NZ) - E/W @ $26.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 22% |
| Place Odds | $7.25 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +83% |
| Specialist Score | 2.98 |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Strong place specialist (score 2.98) with proven 2400m record. Runner-up in two of last three Sydney runs at this trip in this grade, both times carrying 4.5kg more. Significant weight drop with 3kg claimer Siena Grima. Returns from Brisbane runs over shorter trips - now gets ideal distance. Chris Waller-trained roughie highlighted by multiple tipsters.
