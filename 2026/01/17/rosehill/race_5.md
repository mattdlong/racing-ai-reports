# Rosehill Race 5 - Yulong January Cup (2000m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 2:55 PM | Listed $150,000 | 12 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT

Moderate tempo expected with Christmas Cup form lines dominating. Saint George is heavily backed favourite but showing underlay value after dominant Cranbourne win. Rail in true position suits on-pace runners. Each-way value exists at the prices for consistent place performers.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Saint George (favourite $2.60) fails edge criteria at -17% underlay. While he won impressively at Cranbourne, the market has overreacted. No other runner meets the 25% probability + 15% edge threshold with adequate expert support.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Saint George**: If the favourite bounces off Cranbourne win and handles Soft 5 conditions, could dominate and leave value runners fighting for minor placings
2. **Track condition**: Currently Soft 5 - further deterioration would suit proven wet-trackers like Touristic over the selected EW runner
