# Rosehill Race 4 - Chandon Handicap (1100m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 2:20 PM | BM72 3yo | 8 runners | Soft 5-6**

## VERDICT
Fast tempo expected with multiple early speed types (Shaggy, Zumbo, Esmahli). Inside barriers advantaged at Rosehill with rail in true position. Runners with tactical speed and strong place records offer best each-way value in an open contest where no standout Best Bet qualifies.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability and +15% edge thresholds. The competitive field with multiple chances sees all contenders assessed below the required confidence level.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#5 BETTER LATE - E/W @ $6.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 18% |
| Place Probability | 53% |
| Place Odds | $2.25 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +13.8% |
| Specialist Score | 2.31 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Unbeaten in 2 career starts with a 100% place rate. Nathan Doyle's progressive 3yo has a strong place specialist score (2.31) indicating she places far more often than win probability suggests. Barrier 4 is ideal at Rosehill, and the step up to BM72 looks manageable off solid trial form.

**#8 SILVER SERENADE - E/W @ $7.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 15% |
| Place Probability | 46% |
| Place Odds | $2.50 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +10.0% |
| Specialist Score | 2.78 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Outstanding place consistency - 4 starts for 1 win and 3 placings (100% place rate). Strong place specialist score (2.78) suggests she hits the frame more often than win probability indicates. Central barrier 5 suits and soft track form is proven. Danny Williams/Adkins combination in good form.

|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Shaggy | 1 | $18.00 | 3% | 11% | -10% | X | Poor recent form (11th, 11th), resuming without trial confidence |
| 2 | Esmahli | 6 | $5.00 | 22% | 63% | +10% | B | Quality Hayes 3yo, lightly raced, barrier concern |
| 3 | Stormland | 7 | $9.00 | 12% | 35% | +8% | B | Ciaron Maher, moderate form, wide draw |

| 8 | Silver Serenade | 5 | $7.00 | 15% | 46% | +10% | A | **EW VALUE** - Place machine |

## KEY RISKS

1. **Wet track uncertainty**: Soft 5-6 with rain forecast could deteriorate further, changing the pace dynamic and potentially disadvantaging on-pacers.

2. **Market movement**: Odds estimated from form analysis - actual market prices may differ significantly, affecting value calculations.
