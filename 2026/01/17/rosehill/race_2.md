# Rosehill Race 2 - TAB Highway Handicap (1100m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 11:55 AM | Class 3 | 20 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT
Fast tempo expected with multiple speed horses engaged from wide draws in a capacity Highway field. Inside barriers favoured on the soft track with the rail in the true position. Run-on types at value odds offer the best approach in this competitive sprint.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold. The large 20-horse Highway field dilutes win chances significantly, with the top-rated contender showing only 12% win probability and negative edge at current odds.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**HAZEL JEAN - E/W @ $16.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 20% |
| Place Odds | $4.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +11.5% |
| Specialist Score | 3.29 |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Strong place specialist profile (score 3.29) with 50% career place rate. Produced terrific fresh performance at Canterbury with fastest closing sectionals of the entire program. Form franked when stablemate Caffe Florian subsequently won Listed race at Gosford. Slow away second-up on January 1 in leader-dominated race provides valid excuse.

**#18 ROSES IMMINENTE - E/W @ $8.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 12% |
| Place Probability | 28% |
| Place Odds | $2.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | -13.5% |
| Specialist Score | 2.33 |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Qualifies via Path B as place specialist (score 2.33) despite negative EW EV. Last win came on heavy ground over 1400m. Solid return in December Highway at Randwick which has produced two subsequent winners. Hard to miss late work in Muswellbrook trial on January 11. Query on drop to 1100m third-up but testing track may assist.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Large field dynamics**: 20-horse Highway fields are highly unpredictable with significant interference potential, particularly from wide barriers in sprints
2. **Track bias uncertainty**: Soft 5 conditions may deteriorate further if rain arrives, potentially disadvantaging run-on types
