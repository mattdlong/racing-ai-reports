# Rosehill Race 3 - Midway BM72 (1200m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 1:45 PM | Benchmark 72 | 15 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Tequila Baby and Cryptonic likely to vie for the lead from inside barriers. On-pace runners favoured on the soft track with rail in true position. Competitive field with no standout value on the win side, but place market offers opportunities through proven place specialists.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold. Tequila Baby (18%) and Cryptonic (15%) are the class runners but are under the odds at current market prices ($4.50 and $5.50 respectively), showing negative edge. Expert support is split across multiple runners without consensus.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#12 HAZEL JEAN - E/W @ $16.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 21% |
| Place Odds | $4.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +13.4% |
| Specialist Score | 2.38 |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Franked form - finished strongly behind Caffe Florian (since won Listed race) at Canterbury with second-fastest closing sectionals of the day. Third-up pattern suits (won maiden third-up, followed with back-to-back placings). Excuses last start when slow away in leader-dominated race. Chad Schofield booked. Strong place specialist score (2.38) at odds that provide genuine value.

**#6 MOTHER GOOSE - E/W @ $8.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 12% |
| Place Probability | 32% |
| Place Odds | $2.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | -7.7% |
| Specialist Score | 2.78 |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Outstanding place consistency (7 placings from 10 starts, 70% strike rate). Recent Canterbury 1250m win followed by Randwick 1200m second shows current form. Gary Portelli stable in good form. Highest specialist score in field (2.78) justifies place inclusion despite negative EW EV - value is in the place component. Watch for odds drift to improve value.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Track bias uncertainty**: Rail in true position but Soft 5 conditions may favour on-pacers more than backmarkers like Hazel Jean
2. **Hazel Jean barrier (12)**: Wide draw requires luck to get across or settle without using energy; Chad Schofield needs to ride a tactical race
