# Rosehill Race 9 - Asahi Super Dry (1100m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 6:30 PM | BM78 | 11 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT
Fast tempo expected with multiple speed horses engaged (Eye Of The Fire, Bev's Nine, Tai Lung). On-pacers at disadvantage on soft track; horses with tactical speed who can settle midfield and sprint likely advantaged. Bev's Nine will be significantly overbacked given unbeaten record - value lies against the favorite in the each-way market.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets qualification criteria. Bev's Nine (22% true probability) is the likely favorite but will be significantly underpriced at ~$2.80 based on unbeaten 3/3 record, creating -38% underlay. First metro Saturday test represents class rise risk. No other runner achieves 25% win probability threshold.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#1 EYE OF THE FIRE - E/W @ $8.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 14% |
| Place Probability | 39% |
| Place Odds | $2.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +9.8% |
| Specialist Score | 1.64 |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Proven performer with 5 wins and 11 placings from 20 starts (55% place rate). Last start winner, 13 days fresh. Barrier 3 ideal at Rosehill on soft. Trainer Archibald consistent at metro level. Qualifies Path A (odds >= $6, EW EV >= +5%, place prob >= 30%) and Path B (place specialist).

**#3 POWER OF THE BRAVE - E/W @ $12.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 10% |
| Place Probability | 29% |
| Place Odds | $3.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +14.4% |
| Specialist Score | 2.08 |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Elite place specialist with 50% career place rate (14 placings from 28 starts). Won last start, Kris Lees stable in strong form. Brave Smash progeny handle soft tracks. Wide barrier (10) a concern but price compensates. Strong place specialist score (2.08) indicates consistent place ability regardless of win chances.

| 11 | Tai Lung | 8 | $15.00 | 8% | 23% | +20% | C | Fresh off win, 39% place rate |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft track specialist uncertainty**: Track rated Soft 5; horses without proven soft track form may underperform regardless of class
2. **Fast pace burn**: Multiple early speed horses could set hot tempo, benefiting closers over on-pace runners
