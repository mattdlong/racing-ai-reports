# Rosehill Race 10 - TAB Handicap (1500m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 7:00 PM | BM78 | 14 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT

Moderate pace expected with Cross Tasman likely to control from barrier 4. On-pacers advantaged on the soft track with rail in true position. Cross Tasman is the class act chasing a hat-trick but is unders at $1.95 - no win value. Look to the place specialists at double-figure odds for each-way value.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Cross Tasman has 45% win probability but $1.95 represents -12% edge (fair odds $2.22). No runner meets the +15% edge threshold required for Best Bet designation.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#10 PRETTY POWERFUL - E/W @ $18.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 7% |
| Place Probability | 19% |
| Place Odds | $5.25 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +11.6% |
| Specialist Score | 2.59 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Place specialist with career 38% place rate - nearly triple the expected rate for a horse of this win probability. Two solid runs this prep for Waller including a fast-finishing effort behind Alabama Fox last start. Reece Jones aboard draws barrier 17 (becomes 13 after scratchings) but should get a lovely trail on the soft track. At $18, the each-way value is strong despite low outright winning chance.

---

**#9 PURE ALPHA - E/W @ $12.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 10% |
| Place Probability | 25% |
| Place Odds | $3.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +6.9% |
| Specialist Score | 1.91 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Nash Rawiller from barrier 3 is a huge advantage - inside draw on a rail-true track. Career 40% place consistency makes him a genuine place threat. Waller-trained NZ import with upside still. Should get a cosy run in transit just off Cross Tasman. Minor value in the each-way market at current odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Cross Tasman controls tempo** - If he dictates a slow pace and kicks, nothing may be able to catch him regardless of odds value.
2. **Soft track bias** - Rail true but jockeys may seek the middle, disadvantaging inside draws later in the day.
