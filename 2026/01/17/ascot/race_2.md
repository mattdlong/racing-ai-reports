# Ascot Race 2 - Celebration Of Life Day Trophy (1500m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 5:29 AM | BM84+ | 6 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Without Reg likely to dictate from barrier 1. Small field favours on-pace runners with clear runs. The favourite offers minimal value despite strong form; each-way value lies with proven place specialists at longer odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Favourite Without Reg has win probability 30% but edge of only +2% (requires +15%). No other runner meets the 25% win probability threshold.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#6 SILVER EYE - E/W @ $12.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A+B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 11% |
| Place Probability | 36% |
| Place Odds | $3.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +34% |
| Specialist Score | 1.80 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Exceptional place consistency (55.6% career placings) qualifies via both Path A (value overlay) and Path B (place specialist). Won last start at Ascot, proven at track. Strong specialist score of 1.80 indicates places more often than win probability suggests.

**#4 BRUCE ALMIGHTY - E/W @ $10.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A+B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 12% |
| Place Probability | 38% |
| Place Odds | $3.25 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +22% |
| Specialist Score | 1.34 |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Veteran with 82 career starts and 45% place strike rate (37 placings). Second in Mandurah Cup last start, drops back to suitable grade. Steven Parnham takes ride from barrier 4. Qualifies via Path A and Path B.

## FULL FIELD

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Grade | Summary |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Without Reg | 1 | $3.40 | 30% | 85% | +2% | B | Clear favourite, minimal win value but near-certain to place |
| 4 | Bruce Almighty | 4 | $10.00 | 12% | 38% | +20% | B | **EW VALUE** - Place specialist, 2nd last start |
| 2 | Noteworthy | 2 | $8.00 | 14% | 44% | +12% | B | Solid each-way, 1st two runs back |
| 5 | River Rubicon | 5 | $13.00 | 10% | 32% | +30% | B | Pike booking, first-up from trial |
| 6 | Silver Eye | 6 | $12.00 | 11% | 36% | +32% | B | **EW VALUE** - Strong place specialist 1.80 |
| 1 | Desennea | 1 | $26.00 | 5% | 18% | +30% | C | Long-shot, needs pace to collapse |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Small field (6 runners)**: Only 2 places paid, reducing each-way value margin
2. **Soft 5 track**: Conditions suit Without Reg who has won on soft; Silver Eye and Bruce Almighty untested on heavy
