# Ascot Race 9 - Peters Investments (1000m)

**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 9:30 AM | Rs1mw | 13 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT

Fast tempo expected with multiple speed horses (Niccimota, Avoidance) contesting the lead in this 1000m sprint. Wide barriers are a concern on the tight Ascot circuit. No standout value for Best Bet designation but two runners offer each-way appeal at odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold. This is a competitive sprint with 13 runners and no clear market leader showing +15% edge.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Wide barriers** - Both EW selections drawn wide (barrier 9 and 5). On the tight Ascot circuit (300m straight) this can be costly if not forward early.
2. **Soft 5 track** - Some runners may not handle the give in the ground at sprint pace.
