# Ascot Race 3 - MCA Polytrack BM72+ (1800m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 6:09 AM | BM72+ | 8 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Battle Commander and Sowar likely to push forward. Small field of 8 favours on-pace runners with rail at 3m. Market appears well-formed with no standout value opportunities at current prices - underlays across the top of the market.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the +15% edge threshold. Top contenders Our Paladin Al and Battle Commander are underlays at current prices. Limited expert coverage for this race (no specific Race 3 tips found from major sources).

---

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**NO EW VALUE** - Despite strong place specialist scores for Our Paladin Al (1.85) and Sowar (1.49), the EW EV is negative at current prices. The 8-runner field reduces place value (only 3 places).

## KEY RISKS

1. **Market uncertainty** - Unable to confirm live TAB odds; estimated odds may differ significantly from actual market prices
2. **Limited expert coverage** - No specific Race 3 tips found; major tipsters focused on Races 2, 5, 7, 8 features
3. **Soft 5 track** - Some runners may not handle wet conditions; watch for late scratchings

---

## RACE NOTES

**Pace Map**: Battle Commander (2) and Sowar (4) likely to share pace from inside barriers. Our Paladin Al (1) can sit behind the speed. Our Nemesis (5) maps to trail the leaders.

**Track Bias**: Ascot's 300m straight with steep incline tests stamina. Inside barriers advantaged in small fields. Rail at 3m.

**Connections Watch**:
- Clint Johnston-Porter on Arcadia Park - leading WA jockey
- Patrick Carbery on Atlantis Beach - lightweight but poor draw
- Holly Nottle (3kg claim) on Our Paladin Al - value claim
