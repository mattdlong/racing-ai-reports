# Ascot Race 4 - Swan Draught Plate (1200m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 6:50 AM AWST | 3YO Open | 10 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Playin'it Sweet likely to control from barrier 6. On-pacers favoured on the soft track. The heavy favourite looks short odds based on edge calculations. Value lies in the place market with a resuming filly showing strong place credentials.

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Favourite Playin'it Sweet shows -21% edge at $2.25 (fair odds $2.86). Despite 80% expert support and strong form (5 wins from 9), the odds are too short to qualify for Best Bet designation which requires +15% edge minimum.
