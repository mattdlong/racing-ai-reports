# Ascot Race 6 - Bisley Workwear (1200m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 4:25 PM | BM66+ | 10 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Supernatural and Hey Pino likely to press forward from barriers 8 and 1 respectively. On-pace runners advantaged on the soft track. Competitive BM66 sprint with no standout value in the win market - favourites Supernatural and Fancy Red are short of the 25% probability threshold and showing as underlays. Place specialists offer marginal EW value at double-figure odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold. Supernatural (22%) is the highest-rated but comes off a feature win that has shortened the price to underlay territory (-23% edge). Fancy Red (20%) has brilliant form figures but faces a wide barrier (9) on a soft track and lacks Ascot form.

| 10 | Civvy Street | 3 | $26.00 | 4% | 13% | -4% | X | Inconsistent form (6-2-4-8-12) |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft track uncertainty** - Several runners untested on Soft 5 conditions; track may deteriorate further
2. **Wide barriers for favourites** - Supernatural (8) and Fancy Red (9) drawn wide and may need to do extra work early
