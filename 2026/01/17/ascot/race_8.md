# Ascot Race 8 - Reliable Asset Maintenance Hcp (1800m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 5:00 PM | 1MW Special Conditions | 15 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate pace expected with Territory Man likely to take a forward position but not burn. Mid-field runners with stamina should benefit from the step to 1800m. The market leader Territory Man is short at $3.50 with limited win edge - the value lies in place specialists at longer odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold with +15% edge. Territory Man (22% prob) is an underlay at $3.50 (fair odds $4.55, -23% edge).

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#10 GLANCED - E/W @ $17.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 21% |
| Place Odds | $5.00 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +21% |
| Specialist Score | 2.64 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Strong place specialist (44% career place rate vs 17% expected). Upset $21 Belmont winner 6 weeks ago, then solid 5th at Ascot debut over 1600m. Appreciated stepping up in trip when 3rd at Bunbury last start. The 1800m suits and she has the profile to hit the frame at double-digit odds.

**#11 FIGHT IN FLIGHT - E/W @ $15.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 20% |
| Place Odds | $4.50 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +4% |
| Specialist Score | 1.66 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Back-to-back Albany wins including Boxing Day success. Place specialist profile (28% career rate). First metro attempt since January 2025 - Albany form often underrated. Wide barrier (9) a concern but rides back anyway.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Glanced wide barrier (13)** - May need luck from back but connections know her pattern
2. **Fight In Flight metro query** - Albany form not always translating to Ascot level
