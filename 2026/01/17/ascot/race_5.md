# Ascot Race 5 - TABtouch Westspeed Platinum (1400m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 3:29 PM | NMW1Y 4U | 11 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Helluva Goddess likely to dictate from barrier 8. On-pace runners advantaged on the soft track. No Best Bet due to lack of value at current prices - favourite Helluva Goddess is a fair price only. Two each-way plays identified via the Place Specialist path among consistent placegetter types at double-figure odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Top contender Helluva Goddess (28% win prob) lacks required edge at $3.40 (-4.8% underlay). Fair odds $3.57. Expert support strong (60%) but value criteria not met.
