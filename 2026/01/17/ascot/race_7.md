# Ascot Race 7 - BetMGM EBF National Hunt Novices' Hurdle (4358m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 4:05 PM | Class 3 | 9 runners | Good to Soft**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with likely tactical race among lightly-raced novices. Laguna Beach is the market leader but looks short enough at 15/8 given the step up in class. The Burren Man has the talent but edge is marginal. Uptown Dandy offers genuine each-way value as a consistent placer at bigger odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets +15% edge threshold. Laguna Beach (favourite) is an underlay at current odds (-14% edge). The Burren Man shows only +5% edge, below the required +15%.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#8 UPTOWN DANDY - E/W @ $11.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A+B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 12% |
| Place Probability | 37% |
| Place Odds | $3.50 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +31% |
| Specialist Score | 2.78 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Qualifies via Path A (odds >= $6, EW EV >= +5%, place prob >= 30%) AND Path B (specialist score 2.78). Has placed in 4 of 5 career starts (80% place rate) including 2nd at Wetherby and 2nd at Doncaster in recent novice hurdles. Ben Jones rides for in-form Ben Pauling yard. Consistent profile at bigger price represents genuine value.

**Key Risk**: Stepping up to Class 3 company; may find Laguna Beach/The Burren Man too classy on ability.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Uptown Dandy**: Class rise to Grade 3 company may find leaders too strong for outright place
2. **Overall Market**: Small field (9 runners) with clear class horses at front may result in formful outcome
