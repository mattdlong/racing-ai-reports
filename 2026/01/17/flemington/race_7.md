# Flemington Race 7 - Thank You Emergency Services (1200m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 3:43 PM | BM84 | 12 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with likely leader Dirty Grin from barrier 1. Midfield runners with turn of foot advantaged. Strong each-way value identified with RED GALAXY offering +26% win edge at $7.00, though win probability (18%) falls short of Best Bet threshold.

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Top contender Red Galaxy shows +26% edge but win probability (18%) does not meet the 25% threshold required for Best Bet designation. Close margins in competitive BM84 field.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#4 RED GALAXY - E/W @ $7.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 18% |

| Place Odds | $2.50 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +20% |
| Specialist Score | 2.06 |
| Stake | 2.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Rising 5yo with exceptional place consistency (7 placings from 9 starts = 78%). Greg Eurell took time with maturity issues - now thriving with 3 wins from last 5 starts. Barrier 8 manageable, apprentice claim off 58kg valuable. Strong expert support (75% of sources).

**#3 STEEL MOVE - E/W @ $8.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 12% |

| Place Odds | $2.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | -10% |
| Specialist Score | 2.27 |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Outstanding place specialist (57% career place rate vs 25% expected). Barrier 2 ideal for Harry Coffey to find cover. Tony & Calvin McEvoy consistent with this type. Qualifies via Path B on specialist credentials alone.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Red Galaxy** stepping to BM84 after lower-level wins - class test
2. Wide barriers (10-12) may compress field, helping on-pace runners
