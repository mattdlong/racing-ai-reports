# Flemington Race 4 - Black Caviar Lightning Race Day (1800m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 1:58 PM AEDT | BM70 | 15 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with likely single leader. Barrier draws critical on the 1800m trip - inside runners advantaged. Yes I Know heavily backed by experts (100% consensus) but represents marginal value only at current odds. Look to longer-priced place specialists for each-way value.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Top contender Yes I Know meets 5 of 6 criteria but edge (+8%) falls short of +15% threshold. Despite 100% expert support and strong form, current odds of $2.70 don't offer sufficient value for Best Bet designation.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#4 DARTBOARD - E/W @ $8.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 12% |
| Place Probability | 35% |
| Place Odds | $2.75 (1/4) |
| Specialist Score | 2.26 |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Strong place specialist (score 2.26) with inside barrier 3 advantage on 1800m trip. Form figures 1932141x93 show consistent placing ability. John Allen a reliable jockey, and barrier draw gives a tactical edge over wide runners.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Yes I Know**: Despite expert consensus, the $2.70 price offers thin value. Any mishap from barrier 2 or failure to handle blinkers leaves little margin.
2. **Dartboard EW**: Needs moderate tempo to get into position from barrier 3. If pace collapses, may get caught flat-footed.
