# Flemington Race 1 - Tab We're On Handicap (1000m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 1:20 PM | Open 2YO HCP | 8 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT

Moderate tempo expected with Big Sky and Boridi likely to be prominent. All runners are debutants with only trial form to assess, making this a high-risk betting race. The market has the top four runners tightly grouped and all appear fairly priced to short at current odds. **No value identified.**

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the +15% edge threshold. Big Sky (favourite) shows negative edge of -18% despite strong trial form and expert backing.

---

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**NO EW VALUE** - No runner qualifies via Path A, B, or C. Odds are too short for the 8-runner field, with EW EV ranging from -8% to -33% across contenders.

## CONTENDER ANALYSIS

### Big Sky (1) - MARKET LEADER
- **Trainer**: Mick Price & Michael Kent Jnr (elite 2YO operation)
- **Jockey**: Jordan Childs (in-form, 20% win rate)
- **Trial Form**: Won Cranbourne 800m trial impressively (Jan 5)
- **Concern**: Barrier 7 of 8 in a speed race; ear muffs first time
- **Assessment**: Clear top pick on trial form but price too short. Fair odds $2.63 vs market $2.15.

### Mirador (6) - MAIN DANGER
- **Trainer**: Ben, Will & JD Hayes (strong 2YO record)
- **Jockey**: Luke Currie (class rider booking)
- **Trial Form**: Won Flemington 800m trial (Jan 2), knows the track
- **Positive**: Mid-draw, multiple first-time gear suggests stable confidence
- **Assessment**: Best value of the top 4 but still short. Fair odds $4.55 vs market $3.80.

### Boridi (2) - INCLUDE
- **Trainer**: Peter Moody (legendary trainer return)
- **Jockey**: Luke Nolen (Moody's go-to)
- **Trial Form**: Won Pakenham 800m trial (Jan 6)
- **Positive**: Barrier 1 advantage in a sprint
- **Assessment**: Draw and connections make attractive but odds compressed.

### Isle Of Mona (4) - QUERY
- **Trainer**: Nick Ryan (local Flemington stable)
- **Trial Form**: Won Flemington trial, course experience
- **Concern**: Significantly overbet at $4.60 vs fair odds $7.14
- **Assessment**: Worst value in the top 4, avoid.

---

- **Leaders**: Big Sky, Boridi likely to press forward
- **Midfield**: Mirador, Isle Of Mona expected to settle handy
- **Back**: Roar Talent, Nicctini likely to go back
- **Scenario**: MODERATE pace, advantage to on-speed runners with barrier
