# Flemington Race 6 - Vobis Gold Reef (1600m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 4:08 PM | Quality | 7 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT

Moderate tempo expected with Harry's Yacht likely to control from the front. On-pace runners advantaged on a Good 4 surface. Harry's Yacht is the clear class horse with a 9-point rating advantage, but market has priced in the superiority - no value in win betting. One EW opportunity exists at value odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Harry's Yacht meets probability threshold (32%) but edge is only +7%, well below the required +15%. The market has correctly assessed the class horse, leaving no value for a Best Bet selection.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#4 MERRIGOLD - E/W @ $15.57+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 24% |
| Place Odds | $4.64 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +18% |
| Specialist Score | 2.50 |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Strong place specialist (score 2.50) who places 48% of starts - well above expected 19% for a horse of this ability. Proven at 1600m with 7 wins from 27 starts. The Sadler/McNeil combination is reliable and barrier 3 offers a good run. At double-figure odds, the place component drives value despite low win probability.

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Grade | Summary |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 2 | Harry's Yacht | 5 | $3.35 | 32% | 82% | +7% | A | Class standout, no value at odds |
| 5 | Somewhere | 2 | $4.40 | 22% | 58% | -3% | B | Progressive but overbet |

| 3 | Reset The Jazz | 6 | $7.31 | 12% | 34% | -12% | C | Inconsistent, wide gate |
| 4 | Merrigold | 3 | $15.57 | 8% | 24% | +25% | B | EW VALUE - Place specialist |
| 6 | Make It Sweet | 4 | $14.49 | 6% | 21% | -13% | C | Moderate ability |
| 7 | Mixxit | 7 | $32.93 | 3% | 12% | -1% | X | Outclassed |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Merrigold EW**: Needs luck from barrier 3 to get a soft run - if blocked could miss a place
2. **Pace collapse**: If tempo slows significantly, backmarkers may struggle to make ground on Good 4
