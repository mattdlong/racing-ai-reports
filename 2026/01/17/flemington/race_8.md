# Flemington Race 8 - TAB Australian Cup Race Day (2000m)
**Saturday 17 Jan 2026 | 4:18 PM | BM100 | 12 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Saint George likely to control from barrier 6. On-pace runners advantaged but genuine stayers at the weights can run on. Market favourite Saint George is an underlay at $2.90 (fair odds $3.33). Each-way value exists with proven place specialists at longer odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Saint George meets probability threshold (30%) and has strong expert support (80%), but is an underlay at current odds (-13% edge). No other contender meets the combined requirements of 25%+ win probability, +15% edge, and 50%+ expert support.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#5 PRECIOUS CHARM - E/W @ $16.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 21% |
| Place Odds | $4.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +14.2% |
| Specialist Score | 2.59 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Elite place specialist (9 wins from 23 starts with 43% place strike rate). Won Werribee Cup at last start for Symon Wilde. Distance and track suit. High place consistency relative to win probability makes this the standout each-way play despite moderate win chances.

**#6 SHAIYHAR - E/W @ $12.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 10% |
| Place Probability | 25% |
| Place Odds | $3.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +7.1% |
| Specialist Score | 1.97 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Track and distance specialist for Busuttin & Young (5 wins, 12 placings from 29 starts = 41% place rate). Barrier 10 manageable over 2000m. Blinkers on. Consistent minor placings suggest place frame is achievable at value odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Saint George controls tempo** - If favourite dictates and kicks clear, EW plays may miss the frame
2. **Track bias potential** - Good 4 rating may favour on-pace runners; Precious Charm and Shaiyhar need even tempo to hit the frame
