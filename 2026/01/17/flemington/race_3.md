# Flemington Race 3 - Australian Guineas Day 28 Feb Hcp (2000m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 2:23 PM | Open 3YO Handicap | 10 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT

Moderate tempo expected with Aggressive and Wrigley Field likely to sit forward from inside barriers. The rail out 9m favours runners who can get off the fence. Our Chief is the clear market elect with strong expert support but offers no value at current odds. Speculative EW value exists with place specialists at double-figure odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Our Chief meets probability (30%) and expert support (100%) criteria but fails on edge (-16% vs required +15%). Market has him correctly assessed; no value overlay available.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#10 STAR OF ROSSA - E/W @ $13.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 5% |
| Place Probability | 25% |
| Place Odds | $4.00 (1/4) |
| Specialist Score | 2.75 (Strong) |
| Path | B - Place Specialist |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Career place rate of 33% significantly exceeds expected 12% rate for win probability. Proven place performer stepping up in trip with Luke Currie aboard. Second at Terang over 1850m last start suggests distance suits.

---

**#11 ZETHEROS (NZ) - E/W @ $8.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 6% |
| Place Probability | 22% |
| Place Odds | $2.75 (1/4) |
| Specialist Score | 1.39 |
| Path | B - Place Specialist |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: NZ-bred stayer with place consistency above expected rate. Second at Warrnambool (1700m) last start. Aaron Purcell has this gelding ready for the step up to 2000m. Barrier 6 allows economical run.

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Grade | Summary |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Wrigley Field | 8 | $3.00 | 14% | 40% | -58% | C | Class rise, wide barrier hinders |
| 2 | Black Frost | 11 | $4.80 | 8% | 27% | -62% | C | Last-start winner but widest gate |
| 3 | Our Chief | 3 | $2.80 | 30% | 80% | -16% | B | Deserved fav, no edge at odds |
| 4 | The Mean Fiddler | 10 | $3.90 | 15% | 46% | -42% | C | Lightly raced, untested at 2000m |
| 5 | Johnich | 4 | $6.00 | 8% | 23% | -52% | C | Struggled last start |

| 8 | Helioson | 1 | $11.00 | 5% | 15% | -29% | C | Rail draw helps but class query |
| 10 | Star Of Rossa | 5 | $13.00 | 5% | 25% | -18% | B | EW VALUE - place specialist |
| 11 | Zetheros (NZ) | 6 | $8.00 | 6% | 22% | -46% | B | EW VALUE - place specialist |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Our Chief dominant**: If the favourite runs to market expectations, EW bets may struggle to place against quality opposition
2. **Distance unknown**: Several runners untested at 2000m including Star Of Rossa and Zetheros - trip may expose stamina limitations
