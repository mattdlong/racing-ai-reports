# Flemington Race 2 - Victorian Bushfire Appeal Plate (2520m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 12:50 PM | BM78 | 10 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Dictionary likely to lead from barrier 2. Leonchroi is the clear class runner but is far too short at $3.00 (fair odds $4.17). Value lies with the each-way plays at double-figure odds where place specialists offer genuine overlay.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Leonchroi (24% win prob) is the strongest runner but $3.00 market odds create -28% edge. No runner meets the +15% edge threshold required for Best Bet designation.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#3 POLITELY DUN - E/W @ $12.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 12% |
| Place Probability | 33% |
| Place Odds | $3.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +33.5% |
| Specialist Score | 1.39 |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Proven stayer with 8 placings from 20 starts (40% place rate). Danny O'Brien/Jordan Childs combination in form. Barrier 7 allows midfield settling. Expert tip sources have this marked as STRONG BET at $6.00+ - current $12 offers significant overlay.

---

**#6 TARVUE - E/W @ $17.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 23% |
| Place Odds | $5.00 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +25.5% |
| Specialist Score | 2.29 |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Strong place specialist (score 2.29) with 6 placings from 16 starts despite only 4 wins. Last two starts 1st-2nd shows current form. Wide barrier (9) is the concern but John Sadler horses run well fresh at Flemington.

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Grade | Summary |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Zweig | 6 | $250 | 2% | 8% | N/A | X | No form, eliminate |
| 2 | Eagle Angel | 1 | $14 | 6% | 18% | -16% | C | Good barrier, needs more |
| 3 | Politely Dun | 7 | $12 | 12% | 33% | +44% | B | **EW VALUE** Path A |
| 4 | Dictionary | 2 | $17 | 5% | 15% | -15% | C | Likely leader, one-paced |
| 5 | Scintillante | 3 | $3.40 | 18% | 48% | -39% | A | Class but too short |

| 7 | Leonchroi | 8 | $3.00 | 24% | 64% | -28% | A | Best horse, no value |
| 8 | Hot Too Go | 4 | $7 | 10% | 30% | -30% | B | Consistent but overbet |
| 9 | Navy Heart | 10 | $4.40 | 12% | 35% | -47% | B | Wide draw, too short |
| 10 | Amawasha | 5 | $51 | 3% | 10% | N/A | X | Outclassed |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Politely Dun**: Last start 12th at Flemington - may not handle the track. Needs to recapture earlier form.
2. **Tarvue**: Wide barrier (9) in 10-runner field means covering extra ground over 2520m. Will need luck.
