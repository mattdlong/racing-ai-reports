# Flemington Race 10 - Thank You Firefighters Plate (1400m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 6:38 PM | BM70 | 11 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Buccleuch likely to control from barrier 8. On-speed runners advantaged with rail out 9m. Strong value identified on proven Flemington performer Buccleuch who has outstanding course record. Jewel Bandit's unbeaten record warrants each-way support at double figures.

## BEST BET

**#1 BUCCLEUCH - WIN @ $4.20+** [BEST BET]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 28% |
| Fair Odds | $3.57 |
| Edge | +17.6% |
| Confidence | 4 stars |
| Expert Support | 50% (2/4 sources) |
| Stake | 2.0 units |

**Rationale**: Outstanding Flemington record (3:2-1-0) and class edge with 60% career win rate. Last-start Listed winner over 1600m here proving he handles the track. Holly Durnan's 3kg claim offsets top weight.

**Key Risk**: 186-day break since last run - first-up query, though has trialled well.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#2 JEWEL BANDIT - E/W @ $10.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 29% |
| Place Odds | $3.25 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | -12.6% |
| Specialist Score | 5.21 |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Unbeaten in 2 starts with career place rate of 100%. Exceptional place specialist score (5.21) via Path B. Ciaron Maher/David Eustace runner stepping up in class but has won both starts impressively.

| 10 | Our Justify | 4 | $8.00 | 10% | 32% | -20.0% | B | Good gate, 1 from 2 |
| 11 | Russian Choice | 7 | $15.00 | 5% | 18% | -25.0% | C | 1 from 2, needs more |

## KEY RISKS

1. **Buccleuch returning from 186-day spell** - Form reversal possible first-up despite trial preparation
2. **Sass Appeal market confidence** - Heavily backed favourite could outperform assessed probability if we've underrated
