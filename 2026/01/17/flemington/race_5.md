# Flemington Race 5 - VRC Super Saturday (1100m)
**Saturday 17 January 2026 | 3:33 PM | BM78 | 9 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Celerity likely to control from the front. On-pacers advantaged on the Good 4 surface. Market dominated by short-priced favorite Celerity ($2.40) who offers no value at current odds despite strong form credentials.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Top contender Celerity has 35% win probability but -16% edge at $2.40 (fair odds $2.86). Does not meet +15% edge threshold.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#3 MYSTIC REIGN - E/W @ $8.50+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 10% |
| Place Probability | 31% |
| Place Odds | $3.12 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | -12.8% |
| Specialist Score | 2.98 |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Strong place specialist (score 2.98) with unbeaten record in 3 starts before single poor run last prep (had excuses). Trialled well behind subsequent winner Hedged. Barrier 3 ideal for straight track. At $8.50+ meets Path B criteria despite negative EW EV.

|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Luna Cat | 1 | $15 | 6% | 20% | -8% | C | Inconsistent form, barrier helps |
| 2 | Out Of Square | 2 | $12 | 7% | 24% | -5% | C | Good place record, lacks win gear |
| 3 | Mystic Reign | 3 | $8.50 | 10% | 31% | -15% | B | EW VALUE - Place specialist |
| 4 | Egerton | 4 | $5.50 | 14% | 40% | -23% | B | Strong placer, short price |
| 5 | Vain Champagne | 5 | $7.50 | 12% | 38% | -10% | B | Near-miss on EW (odds too short) |
| 6 | Celerity | 6 | $2.40 | 35% | 85% | -16% | A | Clear best but no value |
| 8 | Smart Little Miss | 8 | $26 | 4% | 15% | -12% | X | Lacks required class |
| 9 | Thanks Gorgeous | 9 | $18 | 5% | 18% | -10% | C | Place claims only |
| 10 | Mauna Kea Miss | 10 | $21 | 4% | 16% | -14% | X | Wide draw, moderate form |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Mystic Reign**: Single run last prep was disappointing - may not have returned in same form
2. **Market confidence in Celerity**: If favorite dominates as expected, EW returns limited
