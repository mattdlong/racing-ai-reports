# Yarra Valley Race 8 - De Bortoli (1200m)
**Tuesday 13 January 2026 | 6:00 PM | BM56 | 12 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT

Moderate pace expected with Insain Harry likely to control from barrier 3. This race revolves around whether anything can upset the dominant favourite. At $1.45, Insain Harry offers no value despite clear class superiority. The place market offers marginal interest via proven place specialists at double-figure odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Favourite Insain Harry has 55%+ win probability but is significantly overbet at $1.45 (fair odds $1.82). Edge is -20%, failing the +15% threshold. No other runner meets the 25% win probability requirement.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Insain Harry dominance**: If favourite runs to market expectation, place money is fighting for minor positions only
2. **Wide barriers**: Both EW selections (Airclash bar 16, Ryanman bar 10) face tactical disadvantage in 12-horse field over 1200m
