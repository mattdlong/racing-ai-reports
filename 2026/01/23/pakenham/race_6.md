# Pakenham R6 | 1400m BM62
Thu 23 Jan | 8:45pm | 9r | Good 4

## ACTION

**NO BET - Short-priced favorite lacks value**

Aliano is the class horse but $1.70 represents no edge (-18.4%). The form horse is correctly assessed by the market. No other runner offers sufficient value for a win or each-way recommendation.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Aliano | $1.70 | 48% | -18.4% | 85% | VALUE |
| 10 | Tsarine | $6.50 | 14% | -9.0% | 42% | WATCH |
| 7 | Jewel Bay | $7.50 | 13% | -2.5% | 37% | WATCH |
| 2 | Bons To Riches | $8.50 | 12% | +2.0% | 34% | WATCH |
| 4 | Orovero | $14.00 | 8% | +12.0% | 24% | WATCH |
| 6 | Understudy | $18.00 | 6% | +8.0% | 20% | PASS |
| 9 | Nic's Choice | $19.00 | 6% | +14.0% | 22% | PASS |
| 5 | Power Cable | $27.00 | 5% | +35.0% | 18% | PASS |
| 11 | Mislead | $35.00 | 3% | +5.0% | 15% | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Aliano has the best recent form with back-to-back wins (3.75L, 4.25L margins) at shorter trips - impressive time of 70.32s for 1200m last start. Steps up to 1400m for first time which is the query.

**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected. Aliano likely to sit handy from barrier 2. Jewel Bay and Bons To Riches can stalk. No dominant leader means tactical race.

**Class**: Aliano rising from 0-66 win to BM62 - lateral move. Bons To Riches consistent at this level (won BM62 last start). Orovero returning from 202-day spell, has BM64 form.

**Bias**: Neutral bias detected (LOW confidence). No adjustment required for barriers or running styles.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#1 ALIANO** ($1.70) - Market leader deserves favoritism. Two dominant wins from last two starts (MDN-SW, then 0-66). Jye McNeil aboard, Robbie Griffiths in form. The query is untried at 1400m - all wins at 1000-1200m. Good track record (2/3, 3 placings). 80% place rate career but short odds offer no value.

**#10 TSARINE** ($6.50) - Freedman filly with 83% place rate (5/6 career). Third at BM70 level suggests can handle this. Wide barrier (13) concerning but field reduced by scratchings. Place specialist (score 2.47) but EW EV is -4.6%.

**#7 JEWEL BAY** ($7.50) - Solid 2nd at this track/distance last week (BM66). Drops in class. Strong place record (56%, 14/25). Michael Dee rides. The 8th at BM70 in between suggests ceiling reached.

**#2 BONS TO RICHES** ($8.50) - Won BM62 at Cranbourne two starts back. Consistent type (53% place rate, 9/17). Has a course win. The +2% edge is marginal. Place specialist (score 1.84).

**#4 OROVERO** ($14.00) - Resuming after 202 days. Has ability (won BM64 at Cranbourne) but spell length and jump out form (4th, 6th) suggest needs the run. Course winner (1/3 at Pakenham). Interesting each-way but rust factor significant.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Aliano untested at 1400m** - All form at 1200m or shorter. Step up in trip on a synthetic track first time is a query
2. **Rain forecast** - Track currently Good 4, weather showing rain. Deterioration possible which would affect Aliano (0/2 on soft)
3. **Field lacks depth** - 4 scratchings have reduced field quality, making the race more about the favorite

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No value bet identified. Aliano is the clear form runner with dominant recent wins, but $1.70 offers -18.4% edge against a 48% win probability. The market has correctly assessed this horse. While Aliano's place probability (85%) is high, the $1.13 place price offers no return.

The best value mathematically comes from longer-priced runners (Power Cable +35%, Nic's Choice +14%, Orovero +12%) but these horses have form or fitness concerns that make them speculative. Orovero shows the most interest as an each-way proposition at $14 but the 202-day spell is a significant concern.

**Recommendation**: Watch Aliano for future targets when odds are more generous. If backing, consider small place stakes on Tsarine ($1.75 place) or Jewel Bay ($1.91 place) as defensive plays, though no strong edge exists.
