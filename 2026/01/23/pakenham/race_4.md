## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited sectional data; Frostnip and Shinjina likely fastest early, both resuming off trials.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - only 2-3 genuine on-pace runners. Suits stalkers with cover.

**Class**: All 3YOs contesting BM70; Wintery and Frostnip both coming off BM70 runs, others rising.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW; neutral expectation. Rail position not specified.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Wintery (#6)** qualifies as EW VALUE via Path A at $8.00. Strong place specialist score (2.06) with 75% career place rate from 8 starts. Won maiden impressively at Murtoa (1.5L), followed by 2nd at Moonee Valley in BM70 company (beaten 0.5L). Spelled 80 days but won recent jump out. The 4% win edge combined with 21% place EV and strong place consistency makes EW the optimal play. Draws midfield (5) which suits stalking style.

## KEY RISKS

1. 80 days since last race start - fitness query despite trial win
2. Untested at Pakenham (0 course starts)
3. Softer track (rain forecast) may not suit - limited soft form

## MARKET WATCH

- **Shinjina** ($3.70 fav) - 119 days off, trialling well but long break risk
- **Frostnip** ($3.90) - Edge +1.4% but fair odds, no clear value
- **Hello Romeo** ($4.80) - Place specialist (1.33) but topweight concern
