| 7 | Glisk | $11.00 | 25.0 | 8% | -12% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No established speed figures - 2YO/3YO maiden with limited raceday form.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected; #5 Fundamental Nature and #4 Afterberna likely forward from mid gates.
**Class**: Standard country maiden. Ciaron Maher has two runners (#4, #5) suggesting stable confidence.
**Bias**: Neutral bias expected (LOW confidence). Rail position not stated.

## KEY CONTENDERS

**#11 SHAPENAPIT** ($4.20) - Most consistent form with 2-5-2 from 3 starts. Two seconds at Mornington 1000m (0.75L, 2.25L beaten). Grahame Begg/Jye McNeil strong combination. Drop to 1100m suits. **Risk**: Wide barrier (9), untested at Pakenham.

**#5 FUNDAMENTAL NATURE** ($3.90 FAV) - Debut runner for Ciaron Maher with John Allen aboard. Promising jump outs (2nd twice at 800m-1000m). Well-bred type with good stable support. **Risk**: Debut unknown, rain forecast may impact synthetics-trialled horses.

**#8 INVINCIBLE LOVER** ($5.50) - Strong 2nd on debut at Cranbourne 1000m (0.4L). Strong place specialist profile (100% place rate from 1 start). **Risk**: Slight step up in distance, barrier 6 in tight 9-runner field.

## WHY NO BET

1. **Negative edge across all contenders** - Favourite $3.90 implies 25.6% but fair odds closer to $4.55 (22% true probability)
2. **Maiden race volatility** - Limited form profiles increase uncertainty significantly
3. **Weather concern** - Rain forecast; track may deteriorate from Good 4
4. **Expert tips spread** - Tips across 4 horses (#4, #8, #9, #11) indicating no clear standout

## MARKET NOTES

- Market % = 125% (fairly competitive)
- Favourite: #5 Fundamental Nature $3.90 (debut)
- Second fav: #11 Shapenapit $4.20 (most consistent)
- Underlays: All top 4 in market
