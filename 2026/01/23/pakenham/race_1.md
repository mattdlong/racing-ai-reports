# Pakenham R1 | 1100m Maiden
Thu 23 Jan | 6:15pm | 9r | Good 3

## ACTION

**VALUE: #8 INVINCIBLE LOVER @ $5.50 - 0.5u EW**

Place specialist profile (score 2.31) with +5.8% EW EV. Second career start after solid 2nd on debut.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier | Notes |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|------|-------|
| 8 | Invincible Lover | 5.50 | 18% | -1% | 53% | VALUE | 2nd debut, place specialist |
| 11 | Shapenapit | 4.20 | 18% | -24% | 50% | WATCH | 2x2nds, short odds |
| 4 | Afterberna | 5.50 | 16% | -12% | 40% | WATCH | Maher 2nd start |
| 9 | Kiwi Harmony | 5.00 | 15% | -25% | 39% | WATCH | Moody, 2nd last start |
| 5 | Fundamental Nature | 3.90 | 20% | -22% | 48% | WATCH | Maher debutant, fav |
| 7 | Glisk | 11.00 | 10% | +10% | 24% | WATCH | Moody 2nd start, odds value |

## MARKET NOTES

- **Original Fav Scratched**: #10 Miss Navratilova ($1.75) - market reshuffled
- **#6 Girl Scout** also scratched - 9 runners remain
- Market overbroke at 183.5% - suggests weak race, cautious approach

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No form times available - maiden race with limited exposed form. Debutants (#1, #5) unknown quantities.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Invincible Lover (#8) sat 3-wide on debut, showed tactical speed. Likely 2-3 leaders.

**Class**: Standard Pakenham maiden. Maher stable (trainers #4, #5) has strong record with young stock. Moody (#7, #9) also noted.

**Bias**: Neutral (LOW confidence). No significant track bias detected from available data.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Invincible Lover (#8)** the standout EW play. Only career start produced a 2nd placing, giving 100% place strike rate (strong specialist score of 2.31). At $5.50, the each-way math works: +5.8% EW EV with 53% place probability. Win odds underlay (-1% edge) but place component (+12.6% EV) carries the value. Lloyd Kennewell trains, Zac Spain rides - solid provincial connections.

The main market rivals #11 Shapenapit and #5 Fundamental Nature are both underlays at current odds despite similar profiles.

## KEY RISKS

1. Single-run sample - place consistency from 1 start is noise
2. Unknown barrier draws (not in briefing) - could affect position
3. Maher debutant (#5) may improve sharply, unknown upside

## CONTENDER PROFILES

| # | Horse | Trainer | Starts | Form | Comment |
|---|-------|---------|--------|------|---------|
| 8 | Invincible Lover | Kennewell | 1 | 2 | Placed debut, consistent type |
| 11 | Shapenapit | Begg | 3 | 2-5-2 | Two 2nds, yet to win, underlay |
| 5 | Fundamental Nature | Maher | 0 | - | Debutant, market support |
| 4 | Afterberna | Maher | 1 | 4-x | 4th debut, trial before |
| 9 | Kiwi Harmony | Moody | 3 | 2-6-x-8 | One placing, inconsistent |
| 7 | Glisk | Moody | 1 | 5 | 5th debut, needs improvement |
| 3 | Miss Lil | Stockdale | 15 | 3-8-3-3-4 | Exposed, 3 placings, struggling |
| 2 | Last Piece | Noble | 16 | 6-3-5-7-4-4 | 16 starts no win, 1 place |
| 1 | Contemplate Kate | Payne | 0 | - | Debutant, outsider |
