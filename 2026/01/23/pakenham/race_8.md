# Pakenham R8 | 1400m BM74
Thu 23 Jan | 9:45pm | 10r | Good 4

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #4 SIRIUS STATEMENT @ $15.00 - 1.5u EW**

Path B qualifier: Place Specialist Score 2.29 (strong)

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 7 | Terilee | 2.90 | 51.5 | 30% | -13% | VALUE | - |
| 1 | Paradise City | 3.10 | 47.2 | 25% | -22% | VALUE | - |
| 2 | Stage 'N' Screen | 3.60 | 45.0 | 22% | -21% | VALUE | - |
| 4 | Sirius Statement | 15.00 | 68.6 | 7% | +5% | EW_VALUE | 1.5u |
| 3 | Princess Toro | 26.00 | 32.0 | 4% | -4% | WATCH | - |
| 8 | Empress Of The Sun | 18.00 | 35.0 | 6% | +8% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: #7 Terilee has class edge but resuming; #1 Paradise City solid figures from Flemington 2nd.
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected, #2 Stage 'N' Screen and #11 Drone Attack likely to press forward.
**Class**: BM74 provincial; #7 Terilee dropping from BM78 metro, slight edge; #4 Sirius Statement consistent at this level.
**Bias**: Neutral bias, no significant style or barrier advantage detected (low confidence).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Sirius Statement (#4) qualifies as an Each-Way Value selection via Path B (Place Specialist). Despite a wide barrier (13), this mare has an outstanding Pakenham record (3 wins from 6 starts) and a 44% career place rate - well above the 19% expected for her win probability. The $15.00 odds provide genuine value on the place component at $3.40 with 21% true place probability.

The three short-priced runners (#7 Terilee, #1 Paradise City, #2 Stage 'N' Screen) are all quality horses but none show sufficient edge at current market prices. Terilee is the class horse but resuming from 72 days adds uncertainty.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (13) may compromise early position on the synthetic
2. Recent form patchy (5th, 6th, 7th in last 3 proper race starts)
3. Rain forecast may affect track conditions
