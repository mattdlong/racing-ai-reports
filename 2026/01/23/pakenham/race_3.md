# Pakenham R3 | 1000m BM70
Thu 23 Jan | 7:15pm | 8r | Good 4 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - No selection meets Best Bet or Each-Way Value thresholds. Favorite #9 Foxenberg lacks recent racing (181 days) despite good form. Field lacks clear value.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited recent timing data; Foxenberg won trial by 3L (May 2025) showing sharp acceleration but last race 181 days ago.

**Pace**: FAST scenario likely with Maximillius (bar 1), Charmed Run (bar 2) wanting to lead. Suits on-pacers; closers disadvantaged in 1000m sprint.

**Class**: Pick 'N' Mix rising from BM64 win, has ability but 7th last start at Caulfield concerning. Foxenberg placed at 3YO Open level (Caulfield) - class edge.

**Bias**: Neutral bias reported (LOW confidence). Inside draws typically advantageous at Pakenham 1000m.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#9 FOXENBERG ($2.50)** - Dominant favorite, won maiden by 1.75L then placed 3rd at Caulfield 3YO Open. However, hasn't raced in 181 days (last: 26/07/25). Two recent trials suggest fitness building. Wide barrier (9) in 8-horse field manageable. Career: 1-3-0 from 5 (60% place rate). GREEN: Class, ability. RED: Long layoff, wide draw.

**#4 PICK 'N' MIX ($4.40)** - Talented mare with 60% win rate (3 from 5). Last start 7th at Caulfield (03/12/25) but won BM70 prior. Fresh from 51-day break with winning trial. Course first-timer but distance winner. Trainer McEvoy in good form. GREEN: Win %, fresh, trainer. RED: Last run, wide barrier (8), course debut.

**#2 CHARMED RUN ($4.80)** - Consistent mare (5-11 from 22, 50% place rate). Second last start at Warrnambool BM66 beaten 2.75L. Proven at distance (5 wins from 16 at 1000m). Good barrier (2) suits on-pace style. Handles wet. GREEN: Consistency, barrier, distance. RED: Beaten lengths last start.

**#7 DON'T RUSSIA ($8.50)** - Winner 2 starts back at Sale BM66 (1012m). Then 6th in BM80 at Moonee Valley (outclassed). Drops back to suitable grade. 91-day break with moderate trial. Handles both conditions. GREEN: Suited grade. RED: Layoff, moderate barrier.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Foxenberg fitness query** - 181 days between races is significant. Trial form encouraging but race fitness unknown.
2. **Pace pressure** - Multiple on-pacers may compromise each other, opening race for closers on a day where bias data is limited.
3. **Weather uncertainty** - Rain forecast could shift conditions toward soft, benefiting wet-trackers like Charmed Run.

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market heavily favors Foxenberg ($2.50) implying 40% chance. Based on layoff risk and wide draw, assessed closer to 28% (fair odds $3.57). Not enough edge to recommend at current price. Pick 'N' Mix and Charmed Run offer better value profiles but neither reaches selection threshold.
