## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: War Machine best credentials - Flemington G1 winner (68.53s/1200m), Eagle Farm Hcp winner; class ahead of field.
**Pace**: MODERATE scenario - small field, no confirmed leaders; War Machine likely settles midfield.
**Class**: Significant drop from WFA level (12th in Everest prep) to provincial G3; 7+ lengths superior on ratings.
**Bias**: No significant bias detected at Pakenham synthetic; neutral rail position.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

War Machine (55% win probability) is the dominant runner on ability but $1.45 offers substantial underlay (-20% edge). His recent form shows 12th in Russell Balding and 10th in Everest prep - both at WFA level against best sprinters. The 83-day absence is mitigated by two jump outs including a win. However, accepting -20% edge on a 7-runner field with rain affecting the synthetic track is poor value.

Hedged (10% / $8.50) won the Christmas Stakes at Sandown but was 10th in the Standish Handicap last start. Strong placer (57% career) but no edge at current price.

## KEY RISKS

1. War Machine 83-day absence - first race since spring; jump outs only indicator
2. Rain forecast may affect Pakenham synthetic surface; War Machine untested in heavy
