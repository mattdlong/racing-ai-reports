## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited recent timing data at this distance. I Only Wish has the best recent form figures with 2nd at Flemington (1800m) in strong BM class.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Fiery Deal (#4) and Draw Attention (#7) likely to press forward from inner barriers. I Only Wish typically settles midfield.

**Class**: I Only Wish and Hurry Curry proven at this BM78 level. Fiery Deal rising sharply after 0-62 win - biggest class rise in the field (+16 points).

**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence. Rail position not specified. Neutral expected on Good 4.

## TOP CONTENDERS

### #2 I ONLY WISH ($2.50) - FAVOURITE
**Score: 48.7 | Tier: VALUE (No Bet)**
- Strong place consistency (55% career, 11/20)
- Course winner at Pakenham (2 from 7)
- 2nd at Flemington last start (1800m) - beaten 1.25L
- Suited by Good 4 ground (2 wins from 16 on Good)
- **Issue**: $2.50 is too short. Fair odds ~$3.12. Underlay of 20%.

### #4 FIERY DEAL ($5.50) - DANGER
**Score: 38.5 | Tier: WATCH**
- Last start winner at Cranbourne (2025m) in 0-62 class
- Course/Distance winner at Pakenham 2000m
- Lightly raced (7 starts), progressive profile
- **Issue**: Significant class rise from 0-62 to BM78. Untested at this level.

### #3 BON FETE ($6.00) - PLACE CHANCE
**Score: 34.8 | Tier: WATCH**
- Recent BM66 winner at Sandown Lakeside (2100m)
- Inner barrier (2) advantageous
- Consistent placer (40% career)
- **Issue**: 4th at Cranbourne in BM74 last start. May find this tough.

## KEY RISKS

1. **I Only Wish**: Heavily backed favourite but only 2 wins from 20 starts. Place machine but winning is harder.
2. **Fiery Deal**: Class rise from 0-62 to BM78 is significant. Last time at higher grade was outclassed.
3. **Weather**: Rain forecast - track may deteriorate. Check conditions closer to race time.

## VERDICT

Pass race. The favourite I Only Wish is overbet and represents no value at $2.50. Fiery Deal is the logical danger at $5.50 but faces a significant class test. Would need $7+ on Fiery Deal or $3.50+ on I Only Wish to find value. Consider watching how Fiery Deal handles this class rise for future reference.
