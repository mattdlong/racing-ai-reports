# Pakenham R5 | 2000m BM56
Thu 23 Jan | 8:15pm | 9r | Good 4

## ACTION

**VALUE: #6 GLOBAL ECLIPSE @ $5.00 - 1u EW**

Strong place specialist (90% career place rate) with +7% EW EV. No Best Bet qualifies - edge insufficient across field.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 4 | Fam Gorman | $4.00 | 41.3 | 25% | 0% | WATCH | 0% |
| 6 | Global Eclipse | $5.00 | 64.0 | 20% | 0% | VALUE | - |
| 8 | Quite The Lass | $4.80 | 38.0 | 18% | -14% | PASS | 0% |
| 1 | Aseventy Seven | $7.00 | 35.0 | 14% | -2% | PASS | 0% |
| 5 | Cyclone Harmony | $6.50 | 36.0 | 15% | -3% | PASS | 0% |
| 9 | Nordic Belle | $6.50 | 34.0 | 14% | -3% | PASS | 0% |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Aseventy Seven has best recent form (won BM56 at Colac by 2L, 17 days ago). Global Eclipse consistent placings suggest solid underlying ability.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - limited early speed in staying race. On-pace runners (Aseventy Seven, Fam Gorman) should get soft lead. Suits Global Eclipse who settles back.

**Class**: Field of experienced BM56 campaigners. Fam Gorman dropping from BM66-78 races. Global Eclipse (4yo) has scope for improvement vs older horses.

**Bias**: Neutral bias reported (LOW confidence). Synthetic track, rain forecast - watch for track deterioration.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Global Eclipse** is the standout EW proposition. Despite only 1 win from 10 starts, the 4yo gelding has an extraordinary 90% place rate (8 from 10), making him a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (score: 1.875). Recent form shows 2nd at Yarra Valley (BM56, 2000m), 2nd at Traralgon (BM62), and 2nd at Pakenham (Heavy, 1600m). The Price/Kent stable is elite. Ben Melham booking adds value. EW EV of +7% (Place EV +14%) via the consistent place record makes this the best value play in the race.

**Fam Gorman** is market favourite ($4.00) and recent 2nd at Sandown (2100m, BM66) is solid. However, form prior was 10th and 6th in weaker fields. No edge at current odds. WATCH only.

## KEY RISKS

1. Global Eclipse yet to win beyond 2025m - untested at staying trip in current form
2. Rain forecast may shift track conditions during meeting
