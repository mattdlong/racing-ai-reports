## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout figures - lightly raced field with limited form. Willingham's 71.12s at Beaumont (1200m Soft) is best recent time reference.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No confirmed leaders; Willingham and Saint Aldwyn both midfield runners. Inside draws (1, 2) advantaged if they can find cover.

**Class**: CL1 maiden winners' race. All runners have limited experience (1-4 starts). Willingham (4 starts, 2 places) has most race experience.

**Bias**: Soft 6 track. Willingham has proven soft track form (2 places from 2 soft starts). Saint Aldwyn untested on deteriorating ground.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#7 WILLINGHAM ($2.10)** - Clear market leader. Barrier 1 ideal for Tim Clark to settle handy. Strong 2nd at Beaumont last start (0.63L margin). Best wet track form in field. Red flag: Short price offers no value at 38% true probability vs 48% implied.

**#6 SAINT ALDWYN ($3.80)** - Tommy Berry booking for Waller. Trialled well (3rd Rosehill 13/01). Has course experience (4th here Jun '25). Red flag: 114 days between runs; limited race experience.

**#2 RHETORIC ($3.60)** - Freedman-trained, ran 4th here on NY Day over 1200m. Step up to 1250m suits. Red flag: Compressed in market; no edge at current price.

**#4 EYNESBURY ($11.00)** - Recent trial 2nd at Rosehill encouraging. Chris Waller second-stringer. Wide barrier (8) negative in small field. Some each-way appeal if drifts.

## KEY RISKS

1. Soft 6 track may deteriorate further with rain forecast - unproven wet trackers vulnerable
2. Small field (6 runners) reduces each-way value (1/4 odds, 2 places only)
3. Willingham short price leaves no margin for error

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market has Willingham correct at $2.10. No overlay identified. Saint Aldwyn and Rhetoric both compressed - fair prices would be $4.50+ and $5.50+ respectively. Eynesbury offers minor theoretical edge at $11 but insufficient confidence to recommend.

## VERDICT

**PASS** - Competitive CL1 with no clear value. Willingham likely winner but price too short. Wait for better opportunities.
