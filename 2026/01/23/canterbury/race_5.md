## EDGE TABLE

| 1 | Valimi | 27.00 | 25.0 | 4% | +8.0% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Steel Strike has shown progressive improvement (3-3-3-2 last 4 starts), Golden Loom won here on Soft 6 last start (92.97s).
**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected with Golden Loom and Apuntar likely to press. Suits on-pacers on the tight Canterbury circuit.
**Class**: Golden Loom rising from CL1 win, Steel Strike rising from BM72 3rds - both class tests.
**Bias**: Track bias neutral (LOW confidence), Soft 6 favours proven wet trackers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Golden Loom** (Path A: Value Overlay) - Won here on Soft 6 last start by 0.75L (92.97s). Strong course/distance record (2 wins from 8 at 1550m, 1 from 2 at Canterbury). Soft track form excellent (2 wins, 4 places from 4 starts). Inside barrier (2) advantage at Canterbury. EW EV +6.4%, Place EV +14.8%.

**Scorched Lane** (Path B: Place Specialist) - Remarkable 82% place strike rate (9 placings from 11 starts). True place specialist score of 5.41 (vs 1.3 threshold). Draws inside (3) and handles Soft conditions (0-3 from 3 soft starts). Each-way at $15 offers value on place component.

## KEY RISKS

1. Steel Strike (fav) has the most progressive form profile - could sprint clear if race tempo collapses
2. Golden Loom rising in class after CL1 win - BM78 is a significant step up
3. Wet track may deteriorate further with rain forecast
