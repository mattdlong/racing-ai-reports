# Canterbury R2 | 1100m 3YO Maiden
Thu 23 Jan | 6:30pm | 6r | Soft 6 | Rain

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #2 ZOUSARI @ $6.50 - 1.0u EW**
Place specialist (67% career place rate) with proven wet form. Path A qualifier.

**VALUE: #4 ASSUMED @ $4.80 - 1.0u EW**
Marginal win edge (+5.6%) with strong EW value (+15.8%). Trial winner stepping up.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Stake |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 2 | Zousari | 6.50 | 62.5 | 15% | -2.5% | EW_VALUE | 1.0u EW |
| 4 | Assumed | 4.80 | 48.5 | 22% | +5.6% | VALUE | 1.0u EW |
| 8 | Rajwa | 2.05 | 42.0 | 38% | -22.1% | PASS | - |
| 5 | Avon Calling | 5.00 | 35.0 | 12% | -40.0% | PASS | - |
| 6 | Milk Foam | 10.00 | 32.0 | 8% | -20.0% | WATCH | - |
| 7 | Premium | 13.00 | 30.0 | 6% | -22.0% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited data - maiden field with mostly unraced/lightly-raced runners. Rajwa has best trial times but untested at 1100m.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no obvious leaders, likely even tempo suits on-pacers.
**Class**: Level maiden field. Assumed's trial win and Rajwa's barrier trial form set the standard.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Soft 6 with rain - wet track experience valuable.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Zousari** is the primary EW selection based on career place consistency (67% - 2 places from 3 starts) and proven wet track form (placed on both Soft and Heavy). The $6.50 odds with 1/4 place terms offer +6.6% EW EV. At barrier 7 he may need luck but has shown he can run on.

**Assumed** offers marginal win value (+5.6%) but strong EW value (+15.8%). The Chris Waller filly won a barrier trial impressively and showed improvement last start (3rd at Randwick). Tommy Berry booking is a positive. First-up query but trials suggest ready.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Rajwa query**: The favorite may be better than the market suggests despite the underlay rating - two trial wins and well-connected Michael Freedman stable
2. **Wet track**: Soft 6 with rain - several runners untested on wet going
3. **Debutant/resuming runners**: Limited form data increases uncertainty

## MARKET NOTES

- Favorite #8 Rajwa is 22% UNDERLAY at $2.05 (fair odds $2.63)
- Market overbet on the favorite creates value elsewhere
- Market % 122.7% - typical for small field
