## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Place% |

| 14 | Spring Prospect | 51.00 | 15.0 | 2% | -2% | PASS | 8% |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Lady Olenna has the best recent figures from Highway class runs; Star Prediction consistent provincial winner.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected with no dominant leader; suits on-pace runners from midfield.
**Class**: BM66 metro - most have provincial/country form; Lady Olenna and Graceful Ellen rising through grades.
**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - Soft 6 with rain; historically no strong pattern at Canterbury on wet.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Star Prediction (#4)** emerges as the EW selection based on exceptional place consistency. Career 67% place rate (8 places from 12 starts), and 2 wins from 9 starts at 1200m. Won last start at Taree (CL1) by 1.05L showing he's in form. Soft track record: 1 win, 3 places from 4 starts. Barrier 8 is workable and Zac Lloyd retains the ride. Place specialist score of 3.46 is well above the 1.3 threshold.

**Lady Olenna (#7)** is the logical favorite with recent Highway form and 2 wins from 8 starts. However, at $2.35 she offers no value with fair odds around $2.86 based on 35% win probability. She's the most likely winner but isn't a betting proposition.

## KEY RISKS

1. Lady Olenna ($2.35) may dominate if she handles the step up in trip to 1200m first time
2. Soft 6 track with rain - conditions may deteriorate further; Graceful Ellen (9/3/6 on soft) could outperform

## SCRATCHINGS

#2 Let's Go Brandon, #6 Athena's Treasure, #10 Ishikari, #13 Glowing Rapids, #15 Shezain, #16 Felasuvi
