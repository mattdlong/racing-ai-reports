**EW VALUE: #9 SCARLI JAPALI @ $9 - 1.0u EW**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Stake |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 10 | Allegro Miss | $2.40 | 50.2 | 35% | -16% | VALUE | - |
| 3 | Assailant | $3.50 | 38.0 | 22% | -23% | WATCH | - |
| 9 | Scarli Japali | $9.00 | 42.0 | 11% | +0.5% | EW_VALUE | 1.0u |
| 2 | Oakfield Hawk | $17.00 | 80.0 | 7% | +22% | EW_VALUE | 1.5u |
| 4 | Subarctic | $10.00 | 35.0 | 8% | -20% | WATCH | - |
| 8 | Humanity | $11.00 | 32.0 | 7% | -23% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Allegro Miss posted best recent figure (1900m Canterbury win in 116.61s). Scarli Japali only 0.65s slower winning same C/D.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected with no dominant leader. Suits on-pace/midfield runners. Wide barriers disadvantaged.

**Class**: Rising from BM64 for Allegro Miss/Scarli Japali - both won last at lower level. Oakfield Hawk drops from BM78.

**Bias**: Soft 6 track - wet track specialists key. Oakfield Hawk (2w 3p from 4 Heavy) and Scarli Japali (4w 6p from 8 Soft) standout.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**OAKFIELD HAWK (#2)** qualifies via ALL THREE EW paths: +22% EW EV (Path A), 1.50 specialist score (Path B), and 25% place EV at $17 (Path C). Heavy/soft specialist with 2 wins from 4 heavy track starts. The Kris Lees-trained stayer won over 2300m at Newcastle and has distance credentials. Wide draw (9) is the main concern but the $17 offers significant overlay.

**SCARLI JAPALI (#9)** is a C/D winner at Canterbury 1900m on Soft 6 (won 01/01/26 by 0.36L). Strong place specialist (2.69 score) with 71% career place rate. Rail draw (1) is ideal in wet conditions. Climbs in class from BM64 to BM79 but has held form at BM74 level (3rd Wagga 3200m).

## KEY RISKS

1. Allegro Miss ($2.40) is the class horse and may simply be too good - won well last start here
2. Assailant resuming for Waterhouse/Bott stable with trial form - danger if fit first-up
3. Wide barriers (2, 4, 7, 11) disadvantaged on wet Canterbury track
