Thu 23 Jan | 9:00pm | 8r | Soft 6

EW VALUE via Path A: Odds $7.50 >= $6, EW EV +14%, Place prob 44%

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Action |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Fine Vintage | 7.50 | 50.2 | 15% | +12.5% | VALUE | 1.5u EW |
| 3 | Kimberley Secrets | 4.00 | 41.7 | 22% | -12% | WATCH | - |
| 2 | Cassiel | 4.20 | 40.5 | 20% | -16% | WATCH | - |
| 11 | Remember Jack | 6.50 | 38 | 12% | -22% | PASS | - |
| 10 | Catahoula | 4.20 | 35 | 18% | -24% | PASS | - |
| 8 | Jambalaya | 8.00 | 32 | 10% | -20% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Fine Vintage ran solid 72.62s over 1250m at Canterbury on soft (2nd); shows consistent competitive times at this level.

**Pace**: MODERATE pace expected with no confirmed leaders in reduced field of 8. Fine Vintage and Cassiel likely to press, suits on-pace runners.

**Class**: All runners competitive at BM72 level. Fine Vintage has proven at this class with 32% win rate career. Kimberley Secrets consistent placer at higher grades (BM89).

**Bias**: No significant bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position unknown. Soft 6 suits Fine Vintage (2 wins, 3 places from 9 soft track starts).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Fine Vintage offers the only genuine value in this race at $7.50. The 6yo gelding has proven form at the distance (4 wins from 9 starts at 1100m) and handles soft ground adequately. Coming off a solid 2nd at this track over 1250m two weeks ago, he drops back to his preferred sprint distance. The reduced field of 8 (5 scratchings) increases place probability. EW bet captures value via Path A with +14% combined EV.

Market favorites Kimberley Secrets ($4.00) and Cassiel ($4.20) are both underlays despite strong place consistency. Kimberley Secrets (83% place rate, 61% place prob) would need shorter odds to represent value. Catahoula returns from 142-day layoff - risk outweighs reward at $4.20.

## KEY RISKS

1. Fine Vintage winless at Canterbury (0/2) - track unfamiliarity
2. Soft 6 not his optimal going (2/9 vs 4/11 on good tracks)

## FIELD ANALYSIS

## PLACE SPECIALIST ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Place Rate | Expected | Score | Classification |
|---|-------|------------|----------|-------|----------------|
| 2 | Cassiel | 77% | 48% | 1.60 | STRONG SPECIALIST |
| 3 | Kimberley Secrets | 83% | 53% | 1.57 | STRONG SPECIALIST |

Both favorites are strong place specialists but odds too short to capture value.
