**Scratchings**: #7 Autunno, #11 Let Fly

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Zaphod rates highest on recent figures (1825m win at Eagle Farm in 112.18s), but Torabella has superior class ratings from metro campaigns.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no genuine leaders, should suit Torabella who can sit handy from barrier 1. Zaphod and Warp Speed likely to press forward.

**Class**: Torabella dropping from Listed/Open class (TAILS STAKES, MEMBERS MILE) to BM78 - significant class drop. Career 39% win rate signals quality above this grade.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence, rail position not specified. No significant adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Torabella represents outstanding value at $5.00. The Tony Gollan-trained mare has a 39% career win rate (7/18) and is dropping sharply in class after competing in feature races (Tails Stakes, Members Mile). Her last 3 runs in Listed/Open company yielded 5th placings in strong fields - form that translates to winning BM78 grade. Barrier 1 is ideal for the 2050m trip, allowing Emily Lang to get a soft run in transit. The $5.00 price implies only 20% chance, but she rates at 28%+ based on class drop and track suitability.

**Key Positive Factors**:
1. Class drop from Listed/Open to BM78 (10+ rating points)
2. Barrier 1 - tactical advantage over staying trip
3. Tony Gollan 39% career strike rate
4. Good track record: 5 wins from 10 starts

**Why Not Zaphod?**: The $2.25 favorite has strong claims after winning at Eagle Farm (27 Dec) but is too short. His 35% true probability translates to fair odds of $2.86 - current price offers -21% edge (underlay). He's the most likely winner but poor betting value.

## KEY RISKS

1. Torabella untested at 2050m (no distance form) - stepping up from 1600m
2. Zaphod is a class runner who could simply dominate a weak field
3. Rain forecast may impact conditions (currently Good 4)
