## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 11 | Cutepi | $4.00 | 38.2 | 20% | -20% | WATCH | - |
| 2 | Modesty | $4.80 | 32.0 | 15% | -28% | PASS | - |

| 5 | Boondocks | $8.50 | 37.4 | 10% | -15% | VALUE | 1.0u EW |
| 8 | Aitutaki | $15.00 | 34.4 | 7% | +2% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Cutepi (Kris Lees) and Kadall have the best recent figures; no standout speed advantage in field.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - mid-pack runners favored with even tempo likely.
**Class**: Tight BM70, several runners competitive at this level. Modesty dropping from BM78.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence) - no significant style or barrier advantage detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Boondocks** (#5) qualifies as EW Value via Path B (Place Specialist). Career 54% place rate (17 placings from 24 starts) is exceptional - actual rate 3.4x higher than expected for win probability. Proven at 1400m with course experience at Gold Coast. Barrier 5 is favorable in this field. Weather (rain) could improve track, and this horse has shown consistency on Good tracks (4 wins, 10 places from 16 starts).

While Cutepi is the likely winner with strong Kris Lees/Daniel Moor connection and recent form (1-2-5-7-2-5), the $4.00 price offers no edge. The market is efficient at the top.

## KEY RISKS

1. Cutepi dominant - class above and could run away with it
2. Rain may deteriorate track - Boondocks 0 wins from 8 Soft starts
