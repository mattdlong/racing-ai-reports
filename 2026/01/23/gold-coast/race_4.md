# Gold Coast R4 | 1200m Maiden
Thu 23 Jan | 8:08pm | 12r | Good 4

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #4 ST ANDREWS @ $11.00 - 1.0u E/W**

Favourite By The Way is short at $2.00 (fair odds ~$3.10). St Andrews offers each-way value on debut with strong trial form and inside barrier.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|------|
| 8 | By The Way | $2.00 | 32% | -36% | 70% | WATCH |
| 7 | Britannia Rose | $5.00 | 14% | -30% | 35% | PASS |
| 11 | Head Of The River | $7.50 | 11% | -18% | 28% | PASS |
| 4 | St Andrews | $11.00 | 10% | +10% | 30% | EW VALUE |

| 3 | Prophet Of Destiny | $13.00 | 8% | +4% | 25% | WATCH |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No official race times to compare - all runners are debutants or lightly raced. Trial form is the primary indicator.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected with several on-pace types. By The Way has shown tactical speed in trials, likely to lead or sit handy.

**Class**: Provincial maiden, base rating 60. All runners unraced or lightly raced, no significant class moves.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW (neutral style, neutral barrier). Rail position not specified.

## FIELD SUMMARY

**Active Runners (12)**: #1, #3, #4, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #16, #18, #19, #22

**Scratchings (10)**: #2 Duomo, #5 Trango Towers, #6 Yes Donald Yes, #12 Kayako, #13 Kiavela, #14 Reconciliate, #15 Boss Mode, #17 Airburst, #20 Save The Roses, #21 Weekend Spirit

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**St Andrews** (#4) offers the best each-way value in this maiden. The 3YO gelding shows consistent trial form with a 2nd at Gold Coast (0.8L margin) and 4th in another trial. Barrier 3 is a significant advantage in a 12-horse field where several fancied runners (Head Of The River barrier 21) are drawn wide. At $11.00, the each-way proposition shows +7.5% EV with 30% estimated place probability. The favourite By The Way is short at $2.00 for a debutant with no race experience - the market is over-confident on trial form alone.

## KEY RISKS

1. **First starter** - St Andrews has no official race experience (trials only)
2. **By The Way dominance** - If the favourite's trial form translates perfectly, could win easily
3. **Wide barriers** - Head Of The River (#11, barrier 21) may get home late if pace is genuine
