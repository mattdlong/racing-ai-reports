## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited recent form data; Swag has best figures from 1200m runs (70.89s Ipswich).
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no clear leaders; race should unfold fairly.
**Class**: All maidens with limited form; CL1 level suggests exposed battlers.
**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW; neutral rail, no significant pattern detected.

| 9 | Swag | 10 | M Freedman | 8x242 | 5/8 (63%) | 1/3 | Fav, consistent but wide draw |
| 12 | Paper Doll | 1 | L Kelly | x2222 | 7/9 (78%) | 6/2 | Place specialist, barrier 1 |

## KEY CONTENDERS

**#9 SWAG ($2.25)** - Heavy favourite with best form credentials. 5 placings from 8 starts shows consistency. Ran 4th in this track's MM Maiden (13 Jan) over same trip. Barrier 10 concerning in 9-horse field but should get cover. Market has him 44% implied vs our 30% estimate = significant underlay.

**#12 PAPER DOLL ($3.70)** - Remarkable 7 placings from 9 starts (78% place rate). Six Gold Coast starts, knows the track. Barrier 1 ideal. However, 5yo mare has never won and may be a professional placegetter. Place specialist score 1.8 but current place odds ($1.40) offer no value.

**#3 RIGHTEOUS LEGEND ($6.00)** - Similar profile to Paper Doll with 6 placings from 8 starts. Won trial recently. Barrier 2 suits. First Gold Coast start but handles all conditions. Place specialist score 3.1 but odds too short at $1.80 place.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

This is a weak CL1 field of exposed maidens and first starters. The market has correctly identified Swag as the class runner but priced him too short at $2.25. Paper Doll and Righteous Legend are confirmed placegetters who struggle to win - their place odds ($1.40, $1.80) provide no value for their exceptional place strike rates.

No runner meets Best Bet criteria (score 44 vs 75 threshold). No runner meets Each-Way Value criteria despite two strong place specialists - the odds are simply too compressed in this small field with an odds-on favourite.

## KEY RISKS

1. Swag's wide barrier (10) could compromise in small field
2. Rain forecast may change track conditions during meeting
3. Debut runner (Pungwe River) unknown quantity from good stable

## MARKET NOTES

- Market percentage: 129% (heavily overround)
- Favourite implied: 44% (vs estimated 30%)
- Expert tips split: 4-way between runners (low consensus)
- Data quality: HIGH (briefing complete)
