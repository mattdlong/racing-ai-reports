## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Cindersea (8) produced sharp 63.56s for 1100m last start at Ipswich - best recent figure. Pareto (2) competitive at higher grades (BM75) with 69.9s for 1200m Doomben win.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Lunar Eight and Cindersea likely to press forward from inside draws. Pareto and Razors to settle midfield from wide gates.

**Class**: Cindersea rising from CL2 win - class test but progressive profile (50% win rate, 4 starts). Pareto has BM75 form but inconsistent. Razors drops from metro BM88 level.

**Bias**: Neutral track bias (LOW confidence). Inside draws (1-4) hold slight advantage on rain-affected Good 4.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#8 CINDERSEA ($2.80 FAV)**
- Progressive filly, 2 wins from 4 starts (50%)
- Won CL2 Ipswich by 0.9L last start (13 days ago)
- Good draw (3), light weight (56.5kg)
- Red flag: First time at 1200m in race conditions, untested Good track
- Green lights: Progressive, inside draw, Freedman stable

**#2 PARETO ($3.70)**
- Proven class (BM75 winner), consistent placer (58% place rate)
- 2nd beaten 0.15L at Gold Coast 1000m last start
- Wide draw (9) concern at 1200m
- Red flag: Wide barrier, no wins on soft/good tracks
- Green lights: Course form, class drop from BM75

**#7 LUNAR EIGHT ($8.00)**
- Distance specialist (3 wins from 7 starts at 1200m)
- 342-day absence despite recent trials - fitness query
- Excellent draw (2), proven at Gold Coast
- Red flag: Long absence, fitness unknown
- Green lights: Distance record, inside draw, Edmonds stable

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market % = 127.7% (overround)

The market has Cindersea correct as favourite based on progressive profile and recent form. However, $2.80 offers no value against a 32% estimated win probability (fair odds $3.12).

Pareto at $3.70 represents the second elect but wide draw and no good track wins are concerns. Fair value closer to $4.17.

Lunar Eight at $8.00 offers closest to value (fair $8.33) but fitness after 342 days is significant unknown.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Cindersea**: Untested at 1200m race conditions, all wins on soft/heavy tracks
2. **Pareto**: Wide barrier (9) at 1200m on rain-affected track
3. **Lunar Eight**: 342-day absence - fitness uncertainty despite trial

## VERDICT

Pass race. The favourite Cindersea is progressive but short enough at $2.80 without demonstrated 1200m ability. Pareto offers place value (EW EV +1.4%) but wide draw limits appeal. Lunar Eight intriguing at $8.00 if fitness holds up but too much uncertainty for a bet.

**If forced**: Small EW on Pareto at $3.70 (place odds $1.40) - 68% place probability offers marginal +13.9% place EV.
