## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Rec |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-----|
| 1 | Golden Boom | $3.00 | 43.2 | 26% | -22% | WATCH | - |

| 12 | Give Giggles | $9.00 | 34.0 | 9% | -19% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout figure holder - Golden Boom's best times came at lower class; Metalart has consistent mid-pack speed ratings in stronger company. Field is tightly bunched on figures.

**Pace**: CONTESTED - Multiple on-pace runners (Golden Boom, King Kapa, Liquor) should ensure honest tempo. Mid-race speed types like Wanda Rox and Metalart positioned to benefit if leaders knock each other out.

**Class**: BM90 level with most runners competitive at this grade. Manolo Bling rising from BM74 win (class test). Metalart has shown Open Quality form at Eagle Farm.

**Bias**: Neutral track bias with LOW confidence (insufficient data from today's card). No significant style or barrier bias detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Wanda Rox (#5)** qualifies as Each-Way Value via Path B (Place Specialist). Career place rate of 71% (17/24) is exceptional, converting to a specialist score of 3.38 (well above the 1.3 threshold). Last start winner at Eagle Farm 1000m on Good track, proving fitness. The 1100m suits (4 wins from 7 starts at distance). Gets the gun run from barrier 11 - can slot in midfield and hit the line. At $8.50 with strong place credentials, offers value each-way.

**Against Golden Boom (#1)**: Heavily backed favorite but form has been patchy - 3-4-8-x-5-4 in recent runs. Hasn't won since Jan 2025 at this track. $3.00 offers no value (fair odds ~$3.85 based on assessed 26% win probability).

**Against Metalart (#3)**: Consistent performer but better suited to 1200m. Last win was at 1200m, and struggles to quicken over shorter trips against quality opposition.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wanda Rox has just one run at Gold Coast (5th, 1200m) - lacks course form
2. Wide barrier (11) if pace collapses and race is run on-speed
3. Strong mare but may find this BM90 field tougher than recent wins
