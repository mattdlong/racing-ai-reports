## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited form data - no recorded times to calculate meaningful speed figures. CL1 race with lightly-raced field makes speed assessment unreliable.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Multiple front-runners engaged (Drumshanbo, Hills Of Minto likely to press) but neither dominant early speed types. Should suit on-pace runners.

**Class**: All runners are lightly-raced CL1 types. Drumshanbo (Michael Freedman) and Hills Of Minto dropping from maiden class after recent placings. Icymiss (Matthew Hoysted) stepping up after 51-day break.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - no significant style or barrier bias detected. Rail position not specified.

## TOP CONTENDERS

### #2 DRUMSHANBO ($2.25 FAV)
- **Form**: 2-2-x (100% place rate, 0% win rate)
- **Profile**: 3yo gelding, 132 days since last start (spelling)
- **Trainer**: Michael Freedman (quality stable)
- **Barrier**: 14 (disadvantage in 9-horse field post-scratchings)
- **Concern**: Wide barrier, long layoff, yet-to-win despite showing ability
- **Assessment**: Market price too short given vulnerabilities

### #1 HILLS OF MINTO ($2.80)
- **Form**: 2 (1 start, placed 2nd)
- **Profile**: 5yo gelding, second career start
- **Trainer**: Les Kelly
- **Barrier**: 2 (inside - favorable)
- **Plus**: Good barrier, placed on debut, course experience
- **Concern**: Limited form sample, older horse still in maidens
- **Assessment**: Better value than favorite but no edge at current price

### #12 ICYMISS ($8.00) - EW VALUE
- **Form**: 4 (1 start - 4th of 10)
- **Profile**: 3yo filly, 51 days since racing
- **Trainer**: Matthew Hoysted
- **Barrier**: 7 (mid-field - neutral)
- **Plus**: Won trial impressively, solid debut 4th in deeper field at Ipswich
- **Concern**: First-up from short break, limited race experience
- **Assessment**: Place Specialist qualifier (score 2.33) at odds

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No Best Bet identified due to insufficient edge on the market leaders. Drumshanbo and Hills Of Minto are clearly the two best-credentialed runners but both present as underlays at current odds. Drumshanbo ($2.25) has a wide barrier and 132-day layoff to overcome; Hills Of Minto ($2.80) is a 5yo with minimal race experience.

**Icymiss** qualifies as Each-Way Value via Path B (Place Specialist) at $8.00. While unlikely to win, her trial form and debut effort suggest place claims. The 51-day break is manageable and trainer Hoysted is competent with developing types. At $2.00 place odds, this offers small-stakes value for punters seeking action.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Drumshanbo wide barrier** - Drawing 14 in a 9-horse field means covering extra ground; layoff adds query
2. **Thin form lines** - Most runners lightly-raced; difficult to separate on ability
3. **Rain weather** - Track rated Good 4 but rain expected; may deteriorate

## MARKET NOTES

- Market percentage: 128.9% (over-round typical for provincial night meeting)
- Favorite implied probability: 44.4% vs estimated 38% = -14.5% edge
- Field dominated by maiden/CL1 types with limited profiles
