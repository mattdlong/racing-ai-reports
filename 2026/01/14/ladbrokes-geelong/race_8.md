# Geelong Race 8 - Megajumps (1512m)
**Wednesday 14 January 2026 | 8:30 AM | BM62 | 13 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Ekanite likely to lead unchallenged from barrier 5. On-pacers advantaged on Good 4 surface favouring quick times. Open BM62 affair with no clear standout - value lies in the place market with strong place specialist candidates at double-digit odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets 25% win probability threshold. This is a competitive BM62 with win probabilities spread across multiple contenders (8-12% range).

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#5 EKANITE - E/W @ $16.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 21.8% |
| Place Odds | $4.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +15.8% |
| Specialist Score | 2.98 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Track winner at Geelong when leading all the way. Strong place specialist score (2.98) indicates this horse places far more often than win probability suggests. Three lead-up jumpouts ensure fitness. Chris Waller stable, while not top-tier placement, adds class. At $16, the win component alone shows +28% edge.

| 13 | Tarakash | 13 | $31.00 | 3% | 10% | -7% | X | Widest gate, no recent form |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Ekanite lead query**: If pressured early or slow to begin, the race plan fails
2. **Track bias**: If rail out, wide runners may improve unexpectedly
