# Ladbrokes Geelong Race 6 - Steampocket (1112m)
**Wednesday 14 January 2026 | 7:30 PM | BM62 | 10 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Mr Assertive to lead, possibly pressed by Hughie. On-pace runners advantaged on Good 4 track with rail out 3m. No standout value in win market - main fancies are fair price at best. Place specialist angle in longer-priced runners.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold with +15% edge. Market leader Mr Assertive (22% win prob) shows -3.2% edge at $4.40 - fair price but no overlay.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#8 BOHEMIAN ANGEL - E/W @ $10.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 10% |
| Place Probability | 30% |
| Place Odds | $3.25 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | -1.3% |
| Specialist Score | 2.50 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Qualifies via Path B (Place Specialist). Career 3 placings from 5 starts (60% strike rate) far exceeds expected 24% for win probability. Peter Moody-trained mare resuming after trials - stable in form. Wide barrier (8) a concern but should settle midfield and run on.

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Grade | Summary |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Commands Success | 6 | $15 | 6% | 19% | -10% | C | Struggled in city grade, needs to bounce back |
| 2 | Mr Assertive | 2 | $4.40 | 22% | 60% | -3% | B | Likely leader, good dry track record, fair price |
| 3 | Miss Swift | 3 | $8 | 10% | 28% | -8% | C | Trainer form good but mare inconsistent |
| 4 | Hughie | 7 | $5.50 | 18% | 48% | -1% | B | In form, may press leader, each-way chance |
| 5 | Zadar Sunset | 1 | $12 | 8% | 25% | -4% | C | First-up off trial, blinkers on, query |
| 6 | Lapland | 9 | $6 | 15% | 46% | -10% | B | 100% place rate but wide draw hurts |
| 7 | The Arrow | - | $21 | 4% | 14% | -16% | X | Limited info, eliminate |
| 8 | Bohemian Angel | 8 | $10 | 10% | 30% | 0% | B | Place specialist, Moody stable, EW VALUE |
| 9 | Brave Carol | 5 | $14 | 7% | 22% | -2% | C | Long absence, trial form only guide |
| 10 | Pentonville Road | 4 | $16 | 6% | 20% | -4% | C | Resuming, trial form moderate |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Bohemian Angel**: First-up after 137 days, relying on trial form - unknown race fitness
2. **Market movement**: If Mr Assertive drifts to $5.00+ or Hughie to $6.50+, reassess for EW value
