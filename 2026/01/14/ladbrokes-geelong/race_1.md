# Ladbrokes Geelong Race 1 - Ladbrokes Form Genius Mdn Plate (1112m)
**Wednesday 14 January 2026 | 4:40 PM | Maiden | 8 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with one likely leader. Track may favour on-pace runners. Weak maiden with multiple first-starters and no standout value at current prices. Place market offers limited opportunity via place specialists.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets 25% win probability threshold. Top contender Inspiring (22%) lacks sufficient edge at current market prices (~$3.50 vs fair $4.55).

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#5 HAVANA MOON - E/W @ $9.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 10% |
| Place Probability | 31% |
| Place Odds | $3.00 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | -9% |
| Specialist Score | 2.78 |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Strong place specialist (2 thirds from 3 starts = 67% place rate). Third-up today with fitness edge. Adding tongue tie first time may help focus. At $9+ offers place market value via Path B qualification despite marginal overall EV.

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Grade | Summary |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 4 | Inspiring | 2 | $3.50 | 22% | 53% | -23% | B | Second-up improver, well-supported debut |
| 8 | Bourdeto | 7 | $4.00 | 18% | 46% | -28% | B | First starter, won trial, Hayes stable |
| 2 | Burleigh | 3 | $5.00 | 15% | 42% | -25% | B | Most experienced, consistent placer |
| 3 | I'm In Soho | 1 | $5.50 | 14% | 37% | -23% | C | First starter, Kavanagh, best draw |
| 1 | Turquoise Parrot | 4 | $8.00 | 12% | 32% | -4% | C | First starter, Hawkes, tongue tie |
| 5 | Havana Moon | 8 | $9.00 | 10% | 31% | -10% | B | Place specialist, third-up, EW value |
| 6 | Sussex Duchess | 6 | $12.00 | 5% | 19% | -40% | C | Resuming, form last prep solid |
| 7 | Angelotti | 5 | $26.00 | 4% | 10% | +4% | X | 7 starts no placings, eliminate |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **First-starter uncertainty**: 4 of 8 runners are debutants - market support may shift dramatically closer to race time
2. **Wide draw for EW selection**: Havana Moon drawn barrier 8 in small field may need luck from wide gate
