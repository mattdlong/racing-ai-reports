# Geelong Race 7 - Rex Gorell (1312m)
**Wednesday 14 Jan 2026 | 8:00 PM | BM66 | 11 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with El Tercero likely to lead from barrier 1. On-pacers advantaged on Good 4 surface with rail out 3m. Open race with no standout - value lies in the place market rather than win betting.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold. El Tercero (22%) is the closest but lacks sufficient edge (+4.7% vs required +15%) and expert support (33% vs required 50%).

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#7 TARZING - E/W @ $6.80+** [EW VALUE - Path A]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 15% |
| Place Probability | 46% |
| Place Odds | $2.47 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +8.3% |
| Specialist Score | 2.78 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Second-up improver from elite Waller stable with Jye McNeil (Melbourne Cup-winning combo). Won debut impressively at Seymour coming from back. Perfect profile for place value - likely to settle midfield and run on strongly. High place specialist score (2.78) reflects 100% place strike rate from limited starts.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Tarzing**: Second-up pattern unknown - only one career start. May need further to show best.
2. **Race shape**: If pace is slower than expected, on-pace runners like El Tercero hold advantage over closers.
