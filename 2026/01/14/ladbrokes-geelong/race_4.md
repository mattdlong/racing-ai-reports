# Ladbrokes Geelong Race 4 - McGrath Estate Agents Mdn Plate (1412m)
**Wed 14 Jan 2026 | 6:25 AM | Maiden | 12 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with no obvious leader - COLIZZI and KINGTONDO may share the front. On-pacers and one-run horses advantaged on a rail out 3m. Open maiden with limited exposed form; value lies with proven placers stepping up in distance.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets 25% win probability threshold. Open maiden lacking standout.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#11 STELLETTA - E/W @ $8.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A+B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 15% |
| Place Probability | 36.5% |
| Place Odds | $2.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +10.2% |
| Specialist Score | 1.59 |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Qualifies via Path A (Value Overlay: $8+ odds, EW EV +10.2%, place prob 36.5%) AND Path B (Place Specialist: score 1.59). Only filly to hit the frame in 4 starts (2nd Stawell 2000m, 3rd Mornington 1500m). Proven at middle distances, handles wet tracks. Nichols/Black stable in form. Wide barrier (10) a query but gets ground to settle.

## FULL FIELD

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Grade | Summary |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Cashout | 4 | $5.50 | 14% | 39% | -2% | B | 3rd debut Seymour 1300m. Price/Kent. Step up in trip suits. |
| 2 | Colizzi | 1 | $15.00 | 5% | 15% | - | C | 10th only start Sep. Long break. Barrier 1 helps. Watch betting. |
| 3 | Flying Gentry | 11 | $6.00 | 12% | 35% | -28% | B | 4th debut Mornington. Price/Kent. Wide draw hurts. |
| 4 | Kingtondo | 3 | $6.50 | 11% | 32% | - | B | 5th Wangaratta 1400m. Freedman stable. Good barrier. |
| 5 | Russian Firebird | 5 | $26.00 | 3% | 10% | - | X | First starter. Trials poor. ELIMINATE. |
| 6 | Tryst And Doubt | 7 | $21.00 | 4% | 12% | - | X | First starter. Jump-out 3rd. Watch betting. |
| 7 | Upolu | 2 | $5.50 | 18% | 48% | -1% | A | Two 2nds from 2 starts. Perfect placer. Short price. |
| 8 | Yard Of Ale | 6 | $51.00 | 2% | 6% | - | X | 10th debut beaten 40L. ELIMINATE. |
| 9 | Zayyano | 12 | $17.00 | 4% | 14% | - | C | 10th Sep. Resuming. Wide draw. Minor hope. |
| 10 | Princess Of Sol | 9 | $26.00 | 3% | 10% | - | X | Two unplaced from 2. Tested again. ELIMINATE. |
| 11 | Stelletta | 10 | $8.00 | 15% | 37% | +20% | B | 2nd Stawell 2000m. Distance suits. EW VALUE. |
| 12 | Supergrace | 8 | $15.00 | 5% | 18% | - | C | 3rd Sandown Aug. Fitter second-up. Minor. |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Stelletta**: Wide barrier (10) could see her settle further back than ideal; relies on pace holding up for late run
2. **Market Move**: Upolu likely to firm significantly - if $4.00 or shorter, no value exists

---

## MARKET WATCH

- **UPOLU** (#7): Most consistent runner (2 placings from 2 starts). If available at $6.00+ would be EW value, but expected to be $4-5 favourite.
- **CASHOUT** (#1): Price/Kent improver profile. Watch for market support.
- **TRYST AND DOUBT** (#6): First starter by Doubtland. Watch for stable confidence in betting.
