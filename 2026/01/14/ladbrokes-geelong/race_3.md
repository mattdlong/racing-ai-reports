# Geelong Race 3 - Roderick Insurance Brokers Mdn Plate (1312m)
**Wednesday 14 Jan 2026 | 5:50 AM AEDT | Maiden | 10 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Mystic Rapture (barrier 1, blinkers on) likely to control from the front. On-pacers advantaged on a Good 4 track with rail out 3m. Four debutants add uncertainty but also value opportunities in the place market. No standout Best Bet value with favourite Mystic Rapture an underlay at $3.02.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Mystic Rapture meets win probability threshold (30%) but fails edge requirement (-9.4% vs +15% needed), has only 3-star confidence, and lacks expert support (33% vs 50% needed). No other runner meets the 25% win probability threshold.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#2 DON'T SAY NO MIKKI - E/W @ $10.50+** [EW VALUE - Path A]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 12% |
| Place Probability | 31% |
| Place Odds | $3.38 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +15.8% |
| Win Edge | +26.0% |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Strong value overlay at double-figure odds. Career record of 0-0-1 from 4 starts shows place strike rate of 25%. Fourth last start behind some handy types. John Allen aboard is a significant positive - top hoop on a roughie. Wide barrier (7) manageable at 1312m with time to find position.

---

**#8 CELESTIAL ZARA - E/W @ $8.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 10% |
| Place Probability | 34% |
| Place Odds | $2.75 (1/4) |
| Specialist Score | 4.17 |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Strong place specialist profile - ran 3rd on debut (100% place rate from 1 start). Inside barrier (2) ideal to get cover and save ground. Jamie Mott a capable jockey. Filly by a middle-distance sire stepping up from debut experience.

## FULL FIELD

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Grade | Summary |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Colt Forty Five | 4 | $6.50 | 15% | 39% | -2.5% | B | Consistent placer (3 from 9) but lacks win form |
| 2 | Don't Say No Mikki | 7 | $10.50 | 12% | 31% | +26% | B | **EW VALUE** - John Allen booking, value odds |
| 3 | Druthers | 5 | TBA | 14% | 37% | - | B | Hayes debutant, gear on, trialled okay |
| 4 | Wonderdownunder | 8 | TBA | 13% | 34% | - | B | O'Brien debutant, expensive purchase |
| 5 | Mystic Rapture | 1 | $3.02 | 30% | 75% | -9.4% | A | Favourite, blinkers on, barrier 1 suits |
| 6 | Share The Pennies | 10 | TBA | 8% | 22% | - | C | Wide draw, form has regressed |
| 7 | Zoumania | 6 | TBA | 5% | 15% | - | X | One start for 8th, limited ability |
| 8 | Celestial Zara | 2 | $8.00 | 10% | 34% | - | B | **EW VALUE** - Place specialist, barrier 2 |
| 9 | Kirkhoepasse | 9 | TBA | 10% | 27% | - | C | $270k purchase, Maher debutant, trialled |
| 10 | Russian Duchess | 3 | TBA | 6% | 18% | - | C | Struggled on debut (5th), Maher 2nd string |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Debutant upset**: Four first-starters (Druthers, Wonderdownunder, Kirkhoepasse from big stables) could outperform market expectations
2. **Wet track deterioration**: Showery weather may see track downgrade, potentially disadvantaging our on-pace EW selections
