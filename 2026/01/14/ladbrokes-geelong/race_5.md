# Ladbrokes Geelong Race 5 - Geelong Taxi Network (2418m)
**Wednesday 14 January 2026 | 7:00 PM | BM66 | 9 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Slow tempo expected with no obvious leader - likely a sit-sprint affair favouring runners with tactical speed from midfield. The 2418m staying trip and small field (9 runners) increases place probability for proven stayers. Value is in the place market, not win bets.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets 25% win probability threshold. This is an open BM66 staying race with no standout. Top-rated Hollandia (18% win prob) has negative edge at estimated $4.50.

| Place Probability | 40% |
| Place Odds | $3.25 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +15% |

**Why EW**: Elite place specialist - career 46% place rate (18/39) with 0-5-6 record at this distance. Places 1.9x more often than win probability suggests. Michael Dee aboard, inside barrier 2, fresh after 20-day break following close 2nd last start.

**#4 AMIZETTA - E/W @ $9.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A+B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 12% |

|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Eddystone | 1 | $9.00 | 8% | 22% | -11% | C | Poor form, barrier helps, unproven 2400m |
| 2 | Hollandia | 9 | $4.50 | 18% | 47% | -19% | B | Best distance record, wide draw concern |
| 3 | Motiver | 4 | $15.00 | 6% | 18% | -10% | X | Limited experience, untested trip |
| 4 | Amizetta | 5 | $9.00 | 12% | 35% | -16% | B | **EW VALUE** - Distance winner, placer |
| 5 | Anewdaydawning | 3 | $12.00 | 7% | 20% | -16% | C | Exposed, poor recent form (0090) |

| 9 | Lucania | 7 | $20.00 | 4% | 12% | -20% | X | Limited form, wrong profile |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Pace collapse**: If tempo too slow, leaders may kick and backmarkers can't reel them in
2. **Track bias**: Rail out 3m + showery conditions may produce leader-favourable track
