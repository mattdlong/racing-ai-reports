# Morphettville R8 | 1100m BM100
Fri 31 Jan | 3:57pm | 10r | Good 4

## ACTION

**NO BET - Insufficient edge in competitive market**

Market is tight with 4 runners between $4.20-$5.00. Best assessed runner (Klabel) shows only +0.8% edge - below threshold for confident play.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier | Score |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|--------|------|-------|
| 1 | Klabel | 8 | $4.20 | 24% | +0.8% | 64% | WATCH | 43.2 |
| 4 | Sir Now | 3 | $4.50 | 18% | -19% | 55% | WATCH | 33.0 |
| 9 | Prairie Flower | 2 | $4.40 | 17% | -25% | 51% | WATCH | 28.0 |
| 2 | Sghirripa | 1 | $5.00 | 16% | -20% | 48% | PASS | 28.0 |
| 3 | Grinzinger Prince | 7 | $13.00 | 8% | - | 24% | PASS | - |
| 6 | Wiggum | 10 | $16.00 | 7% | - | 22% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Klabel most consistent - won last start at Morphettville (1200m), placed 64% career. Sir Now won trial but untested at this level recently.

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected. Sghirripa (bar 1) and Prairie Flower (bar 2) likely to press. Klabel (bar 8) may need to cover ground.

**Class**: BM100 - competitive provincial/city sprint. Klabel and Sghirripa have metro Stakes form. Sir Now rising sharply in grade.

**Conditions**: Good 4 with rain forecast. Klabel (5/13 soft) and Sir Now (4/6 soft) both handle give in ground if track deteriorates.

## TOP CONTENDER: #1 KLABEL

**Positives:**
- Excellent place consistency (64% career - 21 placings from 33 starts)
- Won last start at Morphettville over 1200m
- Proven at course (11 starts, 1 win, multiple placings)
- Handles soft ground if rain arrives

**Negatives:**
- Wide barrier (8) in 10-horse field
- No wins at 1100m (0/6) - prefers 1200m
- Only +0.8% edge - market has him about right

**EW Assessment:**
- Place prob: 64% | Place EV: +15.2%
- EW EV: +8.0% - technically qualifies but short odds ($4.20) reduce appeal
- Place specialist score: 1.11 (normal - not a confirmed place specialist)

## MARKET WATCH

**#4 Sir Now** ($4.50): Progressive 4yo, excellent wet form (4/6 soft, 1/3 heavy). Won trial impressively but big class rise from BM82. Barrier 3 ideal. Could be the value if track softens.

**#9 Prairie Flower** ($4.40): Best course/distance record (5 wins from 18 starts at Morphettville, 4 from 18 at 1100m). Barrier 2 perfect. However, current form patchy (5-7-8-6 recent starts).

## KEY RISKS

1. **Competitive market** - four genuine chances, edge margins slim
2. **Barrier draws** - Klabel wide (8), may cost in short-course sprint
3. **Weather uncertainty** - rain could change track during day

## RECOMMENDATION

**WATCH** - Monitor market movements. If Klabel drifts to $5.00+, reassess for small EW play. If Sir Now firms on track downgrade, suggests smart money on wet track specialist.
