Fri 31 Jan | 2:12pm | 13r | Good 4

Secondary: #4 Rathlin Express @ $9.50 - 0.75u EW

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | EW EV | Tier |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|-------|------|
| 10 | She Rex | 11.00 | 10% | +10% | 27% | +20% | VALUE |
| 4 | Rathlin Express | 9.50 | 12% | +14% | 30% | +12% | VALUE |
| 12 | Prestige Ka Ying | 5.00 | 16% | -20% | 41% | -20% | PASS |
| 11 | Tiddy Widdy | 14.00 | 8% | +12% | 21% | +20% | WATCH |
| 5 | Sayersitisn'tso | 5.00 | 14% | -30% | 35% | -15% | PASS |
| 6 | Uptown Monk | 5.00 | 12% | -40% | 30% | -25% | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: She Rex brings the best form lines - 63% place rate from 8 starts including metro Sydney maiden form at Kensington/Warwick Farm. Last start 2nd in 0-70 trial at Gawler (Jan 6) behind 0.3L was sharp.

**Class**: Racing off 201-day break but has genuine BM64 form from NSW metro maidens. The Kensington 5th (Heavy 1400m) and Warwick Farm 3rd (Soft 1300m) are superior form lines to anything else in this field.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Several first-starters and limited early speed suggests mid-race rhythm. She Rex settles midfield and has proven finishing kick.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - no significant rail or style bias expected on Good 4.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

She Rex offers strong each-way value at $11. The 4yo mare has the best form credentials in the race with 5 placings from 8 career starts and genuine metro NSW maiden form that rates well above this BM64 field. The 201-day break is a concern, but the recent Gawler trial (2nd, 0.3L) suggests she's ready. At $11, the 10% win probability and 27% place probability provide +20% EW EV.

Rathlin Express (#4) rates the secondary play. Phillip Stokes-trained 3yo has placed 3 times from 6 starts with solid Victorian maiden form. Barrier 4 is ideal and the step to 1200m suits after recent 1400m runs. The +14% edge at $9.50 makes this a value each-way bet.

## KEY RISKS

1. She Rex: Long 201-day absence - fitness query despite trial
2. Rathlin Express: Untried at Morphettville, yet to win after 6 starts

## MARKET ALERT

Prestige Ka Ying ($5) is over-bet. The 3yo filly has consistent form (75% place rate) but faces a class rise and wide barrier 12. The 16% win probability at $5 represents -20% edge - no value.

Joint favorites Sayersitisn'tso ($5), Uptown Monk ($5), and Yarrawizardharry ($5) are all first-starters or lightly raced with trial form only. Pass on all three despite market support.
