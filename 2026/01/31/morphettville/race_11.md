*Scratched: 16 Longtimedreaming, 17 Startide, 19 Scandalize, 20 Big Brute*

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No clear standout on figures - competitive field with several runners posting similar times at this track/distance. Thunder Shoc's 70.31s (1200m Good) at Morphettville is a solid benchmark.

**Pace**: CONTESTED scenario likely with multiple speed horses (Vexatious Dancer, Angel Torque, Thunder Shoc) likely to push forward. Wide barriers (17-20) for key chances a concern.

**Class**: BM76 - all runners appropriately graded. Thunder Shoc rising from BM64 win, progressive profile. Angel Torque has been competitive in similar grade.

**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence - no adjustment applied. Good 4 surface with rain should remain fair.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Thunder Shoc** (#10) offers the best value in this race despite the wide draw (barrier 19). The progressive 4yo mare has a 62% place strike rate (8 placings from 13 starts) - a STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST score of 2.18. Last start winner at this track (70.31s), now rising in class but showing the improvement to handle it. Will Clarken stable in form. The $7.00 represents a +5.0% edge on my 15% win probability assessment.

The favorite **Angel Torque** (#13) has merit with good recent form (1-5-3-1-2-3) but the $5.50 offers no value (-1.0% edge) and wide barrier 17 is concerning in a field with pace.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barriers for top chances (Thunder Shoc 19, Angel Torque 17) - need luck in running
2. Rain forecast may alter track conditions during meeting
3. Competitive field with no dominant form stand-out

## MARKET WATCH

- Angel Torque well supported as $5.50 favorite - tipped by experts
- Thunder Shoc and Vexatious Dancer equal second elect at $7.00
- Clarence ($8.00) draws barrier 1 - each-way danger if settles midfield
