# Morphettville R6 | 1600m BM84
Fri 31 Jan | 2:47pm | 6r | Good 4

## ACTION

**STRONG VALUE: #1 DARKNCONFIDENTIAL @ $9.00 - 2.5u EW**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Darknconfidential | 9.00 | 68 | 18% | +62% | STRONG_VALUE | 2.5% |
| 5 | Teardrop Rotation | 3.00 | 58 | 28% | -16% | WATCH | - |

| 3 | Komachi | 5.00 | 50 | 17% | -15% | WATCH | - |
| 8 | Wild Winner | 8.00 | 45 | 9% | -28% | PASS | - |
| 7 | Surprise Coming | 5.50 | 38 | 10% | -45% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Darknconfidential won 3 of last 5 (1-1-1-6-2), proven at track (3/11) and distance (3/6). Outstanding C/D record. Teardrop Rotation lightly raced rising talent (5/14 wins) but stepping up in class.

**Pace**: MODERATE - likely tempo with Teardrop Rotation and I Catchem Fox pressing. Darknconfidential can settle midfield and finish over them.

**Class**: First run back for Darknconfidential after 69 days, but last 3 wins were at BM70-BM84 level. Proven at the grade. Teardrop Rotation rising sharply from BM72.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - assumed neutral. No adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Darknconfidential presents outstanding value at $9.00 with proven C/D record (3 wins from 6 at 1600m, 3 wins from 11 at Morphettville). The 4yo gelding won 3 of his last 5 starts before a 69-day break, including a BM84 win at Cranbourne. While freshness is a query, he has shown he can win fresh before. The market has overreacted to the wide barrier (8) in a small field and the layoff. At these odds, the each-way value is exceptional (+63.5% EW EV).

The favorite Teardrop Rotation ($3.00) is a talented mare but is stepping up significantly from BM72 to BM84, has only 1 start at 1600m (0 wins), and faces a genuine class test for the first time. At $3.00, she offers no value.

## KEY RISKS

1. 69-day break - fitness query first-up without a trial
2. Wide barrier (8) though small field mitigates this
3. Rain forecast - only 0/5 on soft ground (but currently Good 4)

| 5 | Teardrop Rotation | 1 | 3.00 | 3-1-1-x-1 | 0/1 | 4/11 Good | WATCH |
| 7 | Surprise Coming | 7 | 5.50 | 4-5-3-5-7 | 0/7 | 1/20 Good | PASS |
| 8 | Wild Winner | 3 | 8.00 | 2-1-3-2-x | 1/7 | 3/13 Good | PASS |

## GREEN LIGHTS (Darknconfidential)

- Proven at distance (3/6 wins at 1600m)
- Won last 3 racing starts before spell
- Excellent good ground record (5/16)
- Massive overlay at $9.00 (fair odds ~$5.50)

## RED FLAGS (Darknconfidential)

- 69 days since last start (no public trial)
- Wide barrier 8 (mitigated by 6-runner field)
