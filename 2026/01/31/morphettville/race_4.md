# Morphettville R4 | 1050m 2YO
Fri 31 Jan | 1:37pm | 4r | Good 4 | Rain

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #4 IMAGE ARTIST @ $6.00 - 0.8u EW**

Small-field juvenile race with limited form profiles. Image Artist offers the only genuine value angle with +13.8% EW EV despite modest win edge.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | EW EV | Tier |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|-------|------|
| 4 | Image Artist | 6.00 | 18% | +8.0% | 53% | +13.8% | EW VALUE |
| 2 | Ole Go | 3.10 | 30% | -7.0% | 75% | +3.7% | WATCH |
| 1 | Big Wigs | 3.20 | 28% | -10.4% | 77% | - | PASS |
| 3 | Expensive Taste | 2.45 | 35% | -14.2% | 85% | - | PASS |

**Scratchings**: #5 Orchid Sky, #6 Tully Hart

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Only Image Artist has race experience (1:0-0-1). Ran 3rd at Murray Bridge over 1000m, beaten 0.11L. Ole Go won a trial by 2.14L. Big Wigs 2nd in barrier trial at Sandown. Expensive Taste has two jump-out wins but no timing data.

**Pace**: Small 4-horse field, likely MODERATE tempo. Expensive Taste (barrier 1) and Image Artist (barrier 2) drawn to control. Ole Go (barrier 4) may need to work wider.

**Class**: All first-starters or lightly raced juveniles at provincial level. No class edge identifiable.

**Trainers**: Tony & Calvin McEvoy (Expensive Taste) and Phillip Stokes (Big Wigs) are elite operations. Michael Hickmott (Ole Go) and Patrick Caboche (Image Artist) capable at this level.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Image Artist is the only runner with genuine race experience in a field of debutants. Her 3rd at Murray Bridge showed she can handle race pressure - beaten just 0.11L over 1000m. The step back to 1050m suits, she holds inside barrier, and at $6.00 the each-way value is compelling. The 4-horse field means place pays 1-2, giving her strong place probability (~53%) at $3.00 place odds.

Market has correctly identified Expensive Taste ($2.45) based on McEvoy stable and two jump-out wins, but that's fully priced in. Ole Go's trial win was impressive but it was just a trial and he's $3.10 second favourite - no edge.

## KEY RISKS

1. Image Artist only run was at provincial level - Morphettville is stronger metro meeting
2. Limited timing data across field makes speed comparisons unreliable
3. Wet weather (rain forecast) - unknown how any of these juveniles handle give in track

## DATA CAVEATS

- Data Quality: MEDIUM - first-starters with trial form only
- Speed figures unavailable due to engine limitations
- Track bias: Unknown (LOW confidence)
- No sectional or pace data available
