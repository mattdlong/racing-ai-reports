## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier | Score |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|--------|------|-------|
| 5 | Florey | 3 | $3.00 | 28% | -16% | 66% | WATCH | 43.8 |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figures available. Florey (#5) has impressed winning last two at lower grades with good margins (2.15L, 1.82L) but first time at 1600m in a race.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Conni Island, Gruelling likely to press forward. Florey can settle midfield and finish over top. Shape should suit on-pace types.

**Class**: This is a rise for most contenders. Florey stepping from BM66 to BM70, Conni Island from BM68, Chur Nibble from 0-62. Chakado dropping from BM78 metro grade - class edge.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - no adjustment applied. Rail position not specified.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Conni Island (#2)** - The progressive 4yo has won 4 of last 6 starts including two impressive victories at Gawler (1507m, BM68) and Murray Bridge (1400m, BM62). Steps to 1600m for first time but breeding suggests he'll handle it. Campbell Rawiller a strong booking. Outstanding 75% ITM rate makes him an each-way play despite the class rise.

**Chur Nibble (#11)** - NZ import has taken time to acclimatise but showed ability winning his maiden at Balaklava (1600m) by 3.75L then running on for 2nd at Gawler (1707m). Exceptional 78% ITM career rate identifies him as a place specialist. Barrier 2 is ideal and at $9 offers value for the frame.

**Florey (#5)** - Clear favorite at $3.00 but represents no value at that price. Fair odds closer to $3.57. Has the best recent form with two wins but faces first test at 1600m and against better quality. Too short.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Florey class test**: Favorite may be vulnerable first time at BM70 grade and 1600m trip
2. **Conni Island distance query**: Has never raced beyond 1507m - 1600m an unknown
3. **Wide barriers**: #7 Sentimental Flame (bar 13), #10 Second Fix (bar 14), #13 Royal Fox (bar 15) all disadvantaged

## MARKET WATCH

- Florey $3.00 (33% implied) - SHORT, fair odds $3.57
- Conni Island $8.00 (12.5% implied) - FAIR VALUE for EW
- Chur Nibble $9.00 (11% implied) - FAIR VALUE for EW
- Thermodynamic $16.00 (6.3% implied) - OVERLAY +12% edge, consider small saver
