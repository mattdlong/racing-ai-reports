## ANALYSIS

**Form**: You'resogolden (2 starts: 1-0-1) won maiden impressively last start by 1.8L at Oakbank, now steps up to BM64 but progressive type. Regal Ripper won at this track 1200m last start, now gets extra 50m.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. No dominant leader - Light The Night, Dampen, and Breakfast likely to contest the front. Should suit runners with tactical speed.

**Class**: First-up winners stepping into BM64 company. You'resogolden rising from maiden but showing rapid improvement. Regal Ripper proven at the track and distance.

**Bias**: Track bias unknown (LOW confidence) - no adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**You'resogolden** represents strong each-way value at $12. Won maiden last start by 1.8L with authority, career record 1-0-1 from 2 starts (100% place rate). The 10-day backup and class rise are concerns, but 20% edge and +23.8% EW EV justify the bet. Wide barrier (10) is offset by likely moderate tempo.

**Regal Ripper** offers solid value at $8. Won at Morphettville 1200m on Boxing Day and handles the 1250m (won at distance). 34 days since last run is a query but Phillip Stokes stable in good form. 12% edge with +9.1% EW EV.

## KEY RISKS

1. **You'resogolden**: Wide barrier (10), stepping up from maiden, only 2 career starts
2. **Regal Ripper**: 34 days between runs, narrow maiden win (0.05L margin)
3. **Light The Night**: Favorite ($2.60) has -19% edge but strong place probability (80%)

## MARKET WATCH

Light The Night dominates market at $2.60 (38% implied) but our analysis rates true win% at 31% - significant underlay. The value lies in the each-way prices of outsiders with upside.

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

- **Dampen** (#4): 67% career place rate (8 places from 12 starts), 2.14× place specialist score
- **You'resogolden** (#9): 100% career place rate (small sample), perfect consistency
