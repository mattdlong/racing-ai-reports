## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Torpedoes posted 83.7s at Murray Bridge (1400m) for 2nd - best time in field. Cathay Express ran solid 71.2s over 1200m at Morphettville. Limited time data across field makes speed assessment difficult.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Torpedoes likely to stalk from midfield (barrier 5). No confirmed leaders, expect genuine speed from barriers 1-4. Shape suits on-pace runners.

**Class**: Weak provincial maiden. Torpedoes has highest average prize ($10,850) indicating better quality opposition faced. Most field have 0% win strike rates from multiple starts - classic maiden battlers.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence (no data). Neutral bias assumed. No adjustment applied.

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Form | C/D | Place% | Assessment |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|-----|--------|------------|
| 7 | Torpedoes | 5 | $1.90 | 7-2-2 | 1:0/1:0 | 67% | Clear class edge, 2nd twice, due |
| 10 | Cathay Express | 9 | $3.60 | 3-4 | 1:0/0:0 | 50% | Lightly raced, scope to improve |
| 11 | Pretty Perky | 3 | $7.00 | 5-x-5-3-6 | 2:0/1:0 | 14% | Course form, good barrier |
| 4 | Kappa Crucis | 8 | $10.00 | 4-7-4 | 1:0/1:0 | 0% | Trainer Travis Doudle, improving |
| 8 | Belongtojill | 11 | $11.00 | 4-4-3-x-2-6 | 0:0/1:0 | 33% | Place specialist score 2.31 |
| 6 | Roomerhasit | 7 | $26.00 | 4-x-9-8-3-3 | 0:0/0:0 | 40% | First time at distance, query |

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Torpedoes** is the obvious horse - lightly raced 3yo with two consecutive seconds, stepping up to 1400m off a strong 1.5L defeat at Murray Bridge. Trainer Michael Hickmott and jockey Todd Pannell is a capable combination. The form stacks up as clearly superior to this weak maiden field.

**However, $1.90 represents no value.** Fair odds calculate to $2.86 (35% probability). The market has the horse 33.5% too short. This is a classic "right horse, wrong price" scenario. In a maiden with 11 runners, anything can happen - interference, slow beginning, racing greenly. The risk-reward at $1.90 is unfavorable.

**Cathay Express** is the danger at $3.60 but also offers no value (-20.8% edge). Lightly raced filly by Aaron Bain improving each start.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Torpedoes too short**: 35% true probability vs 52.6% implied - massive underlay
2. **Maiden volatility**: 11 runners, inexperienced horses, anything can happen
3. **Wide barriers**: Top chances drawn 5, 9, 11 - adds race difficulty

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

Belongtojill (2.31) and Roomerhasit (2.31) rate as strong place specialists but at $11 and $26 respectively, the place odds don't compensate for their low win chances.
