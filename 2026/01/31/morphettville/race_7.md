# Morphettville R7 | 2000m BM66
Fri 31 Jan | 3:22pm | 15r | Good 4

## ACTION

**VALUE: #10 MRS PENNY CRACKER @ $4.60 - 0.5u WIN**

Marginal edge detected (+1.2%) on favorite with strong recent form. Small-stake value play only due to first attempt at 2000m and class rise concerns.

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Mrs Penny Cracker (#10) has the strongest recent form with 1-2-2-1-3-4 from last 6, winning at Gawler 1707m on Jan 3. Has never raced beyond 1707m but progressive profile suggests she can handle the trip. Coorong Tycoon (#1) is the proven 2000m performer (2 wins from 3 starts at trip) but wide barrier 17 is a significant negative.

**Class**: This is a competitive BM66 with several horses rising in class after recent wins. Mrs Penny Cracker steps up after dominating 0-62 grade. Coorong Tycoon has BM66 experience and ran 2nd in this grade at Murray Bridge on Jan 10.

**Distance**: Major query on many runners first time at 2000m. Coorong Tycoon (#1) has proven 2000m form. Thinkingnintynine (#19) won at Morphettville Parks over 1950m. Most of the shorter-priced runners are stepping up in trip for the first time.

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected. Several on-pace types including Garcon Renard (#6) and Kikorangi (#17) should ensure genuine speed. Stalkers and midfield runners favored in this scenario.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Mrs Penny Cracker (#10) rates the marginal value play at $4.60 despite the distance query. Her form line is superior - 4 placings from last 5 starts with 2 wins, and she demolished a 0-62 field at Gawler winning by 2.3L. The step to 2000m is the unknown but her breeding (by Sebring) and racing style suggest she can handle it. Barrier 9 is workable in a large field.

The main danger Coorong Tycoon (#1) has the proven 2000m form but barrier 17 is brutal in a staying race. He needs luck from the wide draw and historically performs better on soft tracks (2 wins from 3 soft starts vs 0 from 3 good).

## KEY RISKS

1. Mrs Penny Cracker untested beyond 1707m - stamina query at genuine 2000m
2. Large field (15 runners) with rain forecast - track could deteriorate
3. Coorong Tycoon's soft track form could come into play if conditions change

## MARKET WATCH

- #10 Mrs Penny Cracker: Fair value around $4.55, current $4.60 offers slim edge
- #5 Smother: At $11 approaching fair odds if you rate his maiden win highly
- #1 Coorong Tycoon: Would need $7+ to represent value given barrier
