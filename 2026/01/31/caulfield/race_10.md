## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Stealth Of Night (16) is the standout with 4 wins from 6 starts (67%) including back-to-back BM70 wins at Sandown. Rises in class significantly. Supernima (12) won last start at Flemington BM84 over this trip - proven at level. Zouper Fund (6) has exceptional 63% win rate from 8 starts, though untested at 1400m.

**Class**: This is a step up for the favourite from BM70 to BM84. Supernima already proven at BM84 level with a last-start win. Zouper Fund rises from BM74 but has beaten useful horses.

**Distance**: Stealth Of Night has 3 wins from 3 starts at 1400m - key positive. Supernima 1 win from 8 at trip (untried here). Zouper Fund untested at 1400m - query.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - assume neutral. Rail position not specified.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Supernima** offers value at $11 after winning BM84 at Flemington last start. Peter Moody/Katherine Coleman runners in good form, Michael Dee retains the ride. Strong place consistency (67% career) makes EW attractive. Wide barrier (14) manageable in 15-runner field with rain forecast potentially aiding those off the speed.

**Zouper Fund** at $12 represents speculative EW value. Exceptional 88% place rate from 8 starts shows remarkable consistency. First try at 1400m is the query, but Ciaron Maher runners handle distance rises well. Good barrier (6) an advantage.

**Stealth Of Night** is the class horse but $2.50 offers no value for a BM70 graduate facing a significant class rise. Market has overreacted to impressive form at lower level.

## KEY RISKS

1. Stealth Of Night may simply be too good despite class rise - first metro BM84 test
2. Rain forecast - Good 4 may deteriorate; Zouper Fund untested on wet, Supernima handles soft
3. Supernima barrier 14 requires luck in running
4. Zouper Fund untested at 1400m

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

| Horse | Place Rate | Expected | Specialist Score |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Zouper Fund | 87.5% | 18.9% | 4.63 (STRONG) |
| Supernima | 66.7% | 21.0% | 3.18 (STRONG) |
| Porter | 61.5% | 25.2% | 2.44 (STRONG) |
