## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Hedonist posted 80.82s at Warrnambool (BM78 win by 5L) - fastest recent 1400m time in field. Tarzing untested at trip but improving.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. No dominant leaders; Hedonist, Two Wolves likely to sit handy. Suits on-pace runners from good barriers.

**Class**: Hedonist rises from BM70 win but 5L margin suggests in hand. Tarzing (2 from 2) and Two Wolves (2 from 4) both lightly raced with upside but stepping up significantly in grade.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - no adjustment applied. Good 4 with rain may deteriorate.

*Scratched: #4 Yam*

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Hedonist** is the standout on recent form. His 5-length BM78 win at Warrnambool (80.82s) represents the best speed figure in the field at this distance. While the market has him correctly assessed for win probability (no positive edge), the **each-way value is genuine at +7.8% EV** due to his outstanding 80% career place rate (12/15) translating to 75% modeled place probability.

The rail draw (barrier 1) is a significant advantage in an 11-horse field with rain forecast. Jockey J. Weatherley takes the ride for Tom Dabernig. First time at Caulfield is the query, but his form at similar metro tracks (Flemington 4th) suggests he handles the step up.

**Tarzing** is the danger - unbeaten in 2 starts for Chris Waller and stepping up to 1400m for the first time. However, market has priced in the hype (-23% edge) and barrier 9 is a concern. Watch list only.

## KEY RISKS

1. **First start at Caulfield** - Hedonist untested at track, though Warrnambool form is strong
2. **Rain deterioration** - Track currently Good 4 but rain forecast; Hedonist 0/1 on Soft
3. **Tarzing unknown ceiling** - Waller's unbeaten progressive type may be special

## MARKET NOTES

- Market: 123% overround
- Favorite: #5 Hedonist @ $3.40 (29% implied)
- Expert consensus: Split - #5, #11, #12, #8 all mentioned (1 source)
- Place odds: $1.40 (implied 71% vs modeled 75% = value)
