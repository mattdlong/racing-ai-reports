## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Sun Gift comes in with back-to-back wins at BM74/78 level and is the class act stepping up. Dictionary won last start at Flemington over 2520m in BM78 grade and relishes this distance with a proven C/D record (5:1-0).

**Class**: This is a rise to BM84 for most runners. Dictionary ran 1st in a VG Stayers race at this track/distance in July and has genuine staying credentials. Sun Gift is progressive but untested at this grade.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No genuine leaders - most are midfield runners. Likely slow early with a sprint home suiting horses with tactical speed.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - assuming neutral. No significant rail or style advantage detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Dictionary** (#4) represents the value play at $8.00. Last-start winner at Flemington over 2520m in BM78 grade - that form is directly applicable here. Proven at Caulfield 2400m (won VG Stayers in July). The place specialist score of 1.31 and +12% edge on win, with EW EV of +11%, makes this the betting proposition. Rising in class but has run in stronger company previously.

Sun Gift is the most likely winner but is overbet at $3.00. Fair odds closer to $3.33. The form is good but first time at BM84 and first time at Caulfield - both unknowns worth discounting.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Dictionary**: Wide barrier (7) in small field may burn petrol; needs luck in running
2. **Sun Gift**: First time at this class level and untested at track - priced too short for unknowns

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**Dictionary** qualifies via Path A:
- Odds >= $6 (actual: $8)
- EW EV >= +5% (actual: +11%)
- Place prob >= 30% (actual: 38%)
- Place specialist score: 1.31 (qualifies as specialist)

Place odds of $2.75 with 38% place probability = +10% place EV.
