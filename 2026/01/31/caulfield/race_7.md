# Caulfield R7 | 1200m BM78
Fri 31 Jan | 3:45pm | 11r | Good 4

## ACTION

**VALUE: #2 PROVED @ $10 - 1.4u EW**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 2 | Proved | 10.00 | 58 | 15% | +50% | VALUE | 1.4% |
| 4 | Aviatress | 4.50 | 52 | 22% | -1% | WATCH | - |
| 7 | A Little Deep | 5.00 | 48 | 18% | -10% | WATCH | - |
| 3 | Damask Rose | 5.50 | 45 | 16% | -12% | WATCH | - |
| 5 | Samangu | 8.50 | 44 | 12% | -15% | WATCH | - |
| 11 | Bossy Benita | 11.00 | 42 | 10% | +10% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Proved is the standout progressive type - 6 wins from 8 starts (75%) with a perfect 4/4 at 1200m. His Caulfield win on 15/11 (70.17s) is the best speed figure in this field.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Aviatress and Samangu likely to be prominent. Proved has tactical speed to sit handy.

**Class**: All runners competitive at BM78 level. Damask Rose dropping from Group company but form has been ordinary.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - assume neutral. Rail position not specified.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Proved represents genuine each-way value at $10. His lightly-raced profile (8 starts) suggests upside remains, and his perfect 1200m record (4/4) is compelling. The 48-day break is a concern, but he trialled adequately (4th in jump-out on 26/1). His only poor run came on soft/heavy going at Pakenham - today's Good 4 surface suits.

The market favours Aviatress ($4.50) who has solid claims with 2 Caulfield wins, but her price offers no edge. Proved's EW value (45.7% EV) makes him the clear betting proposition.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Fitness query**: 48 days since last race start, relying on one jump-out
2. **Wet track threat**: Rain forecast - Proved is 0/1 on soft, monitor conditions
3. **Field strength**: Aviatress and A Little Deep are proven metro performers
