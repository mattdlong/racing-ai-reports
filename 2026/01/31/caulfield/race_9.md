*Scratched: #4 Mister Me, #6 Make It Sweet*

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: #8 Pure Alpha has the best NSW BM78 credentials with 2nds at 1800m. #7 Midnite Storm won last at BM70 but rises sharply. #13 Extreme Virtue is the only course winner in the field.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No dominant leader, likely tactical race with #3 New York Hurricane (barrier 1) and #12 Seafall (barrier 2) potentially leading. Suits off-pace runners.

**Class**: BM84 metro is a significant test. #7 Midnite Storm jumping 2 grades (BM70 to BM84) is the main query. Most runners have been competitive at BM78 level but none have proven BM84 form.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence. Rail position not specified. Assuming neutral conditions.

## KEY CONTENDERS

**#8 Pure Alpha** ($3.40) - MARKET FAVOURITE
- Waller/Lane first Victorian start
- 2nd at 1800m Rosehill BM78 (June) - best distance form
- Soft/heavy track form is superior; Good track form is weaker (0 wins from 6)
- Barrier 6 suits tactical ride
- Risk: Good track query, first Vic start

**#7 Midnite Storm** ($4.20) - DANGER
- Won BM70 Flemington 1600m last start impressively
- UK form at Class 3-5 level translates reasonably
- Maher stable in form
- Risk: Rising 2 classes (BM70→BM84), wide barrier (12), distance query (1600→1800)

**#13 Extreme Virtue** ($8.00) - EACH-WAY WATCH
- Only Caulfield winner in field (1400m)
- Hayes stable, Craig Williams booking is positive
- Good barrier (3), consistent placer (53%)
- Risk: Recent form ordinary (4-5-4-9), stepping up in distance

**#10 Georgie Get Mad** ($7.00) - PLACE CHANCE
- Quick backup (6 days) after 3rd at Caulfield 1400m
- Course form solid (0 wins but competitive)
- Distance query (stepping to 1800m)

## KEY RISKS

1. **Market favourite query**: #8 Pure Alpha has 0 wins from 6 Good track starts - track condition concern
2. **Class rise**: #7 Midnite Storm jumping 2 grades is aggressive; market appears overconfident
3. **No proven distance form**: Most runners unproven at 1800m Caulfield

## PLACE SPECIALIST NOTE

#1 Flamin' Romans: Career 65% place rate (13/20) flags as STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST (5.4x score). However, recent form poor (8th last start). Monitor for place betting if market drifts further.

## VERDICT

**PASS** - No value identified. Market efficiently priced.

The favorite #8 Pure Alpha is the most likely winner on credentials but offers no edge at $3.40. The Good track concern (0 from 6) combined with first Victorian start introduces uncertainty not reflected in the price.

#7 Midnite Storm is over-bet given the 2-class rise. UK form while decent doesn't automatically translate to BM84 metro standard.

Recommend monitoring for late market movements. If #13 Extreme Virtue drifts to $10+, reassess for each-way value.
