## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Du Clisson posted 57.36s at Warrnambool (2.75L win) - fastest recent figure in field. Rhia's 58.39s adequate at this level.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Jennyanydots (#5, barrier 1) likely leads. Rhia and Du Clisson both race on-pace to midfield - ideal for anticipated scenario.

**Class**: Both selections up to BM66 after recent wins. Du Clisson won BM66 last start by 2.75L. Rhia won BM62 - slight class rise but form compelling.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence (no recent data). Assumed neutral - inside barriers (1-6) marginal advantage at Caulfield 1000m.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#11 RHIA** (A&S Freedman / L Currie): Elite connections with 43% win rate (3/7). Perfect 2/2 at 1000m. Won last start BM62 by 1.25L at Seymour (65.45s). Barrier 2 ideal for Caulfield straight course. 71% place rate suggests excellent EW proposition at $6.00 (+20% edge). The only concern is class rise from BM62 to BM66 but Freedman stable targets races well.

**#12 DU CLISSON** (T Dabernig / J Weatherley): Runaway last-start winner at BM66 level (2.75L margin, 57.36s). Has won 3/5 at 1000m with margins of 2.75L, 3L, 1.75L - clearly superior at this trip. 78% place rate (7/9 career). Barrier 6 acceptable. The +10% edge offers value, though less than Rhia.

**PASS on Runlikenencryption (#7)**: Favorite at $4.20 but -24% underlay. Finished 4th last start at Flemington (58.71s). Better record on Good tracks (3/5) but price too short relative to assessed probability (18%).

## KEY RISKS

1. **Rhia**: First Caulfield start - untested on course. Class rise from BM62.
2. **Du Clisson**: Provincial-track form may not translate to metro. Trainer Dabernig 12% metro win rate.
3. **Weather**: Rain forecast - track may deteriorate. Both selections prefer Good ground.

## MARKET WATCH

- Runlikenencryption $4.20 FAV is clear underlay (-24% edge)
- Expert tips split across 4 horses (25% each: #2, #7, #11, #12)
- Market % 125.4% indicates strong book
