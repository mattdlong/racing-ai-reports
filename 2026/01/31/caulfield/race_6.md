# Caulfield R6 | 1000m 2YO Top Tote
Fri 31 Jan | 3:10pm | 8r | Good 4 | Rain

## ACTION

**VALUE: #8 LA GITANA @ $10.00 - 0.8u EW**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | EW EV | Tier |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|--------|-------|------|
| 1 | Big Sky | 2 | 1.95 | 38% | -26% | 85% | - | PASS |
| 8 | La Gitana | 4 | 10.00 | 15% | +50% | 46% | +50% | VALUE |

| 5 | Mirador | 9 | 11.00 | 8% | -12% | 29% | - | PASS |
| 2 | Invincible Son | 1 | 9.00 | 6% | -46% | 20% | - | PASS |
| 3 | Captive Rock | 5 | 61.00 | 2% | - | 8% | - | PASS |
| 9 | Orchid Sky | 8 | 67.00 | 1% | - | 5% | - | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Big Sky dominated debut (2.75L), but faces tougher here at cramped odds. La Gitana from Hayes stable showed ability in trial (3rd, beaten 1.75L) with strong jump-out form.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Big Sky will press forward from barrier 2. Jadzia likely to stalk. La Gitana has tactical speed from good barrier 4.

**Class**: All 2YOs with limited exposure. Big Sky rated highest on debut performance. La Gitana and Jadzia trialled well against each other (Jadzia won by 1L).

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - no significant adjustment applied.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

La Gitana represents the value play at $10. From the powerful Hayes stable with Damian Lane booked, she trialled competitively behind Jadzia (now $3.90) when 3rd at Caulfield Heath. Two impressive jump-out wins prior suggest ability. At 5x the price of the trial winner, the each-way value is compelling - 50% EW EV with 46% place probability. Big Sky is clearly the class runner but $1.95 offers no margin for error against untested but well-bred types.

## KEY RISKS

1. Debut runners are inherently risky - limited form to assess
2. Big Sky may be a class above if debut form is accurate
3. Rain forecast could impact track conditions

## MARKET ANALYSIS

- Big Sky: $1.95 (51% implied) vs 38% assessed = UNDERLAY
- Jadzia: $3.90 (26% implied) vs 20% assessed = UNDERLAY
- La Gitana: $10.00 (10% implied) vs 15% assessed = +50% OVERLAY

## FIELD SUMMARY

| # | Horse | Trainer | Form | Comment |
|---|-------|---------|------|---------|
| 1 | Big Sky | Price/Kent | 1 | Dominant debut winner, short odds no value |
| 2 | Invincible Son | Griffiths | 3 | One start for 3rd, needs improvement |
| 3 | Captive Rock | Zahra | - | Debut, jump-out form only |
| 4 | Lady Of Five | Hulbert | 1-2-x | QLD form, 97 days off, query fitness |
| 5 | Mirador | Hayes | 2 | 2nd to Big Sky, wide barrier concern |
| 6 | Expensive Taste | McEvoy | - | SCRATCHED |
| 7 | Jadzia | Begg | T1 | Trial winner, danger but short |
| 8 | La Gitana | Hayes | T3 | VALUE - trials well, big price |
| 9 | Orchid Sky | Kearney | - | Jump-outs only, needs more |
