Fri 31 Jan | 2:35pm | 10r | Good 4

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | EW EV | Tier |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|-------|------|
| 2 | Our Chief | 3.30 | 24% | -20.8% | 66% | -8.4% | PASS |
| 1 | Jenni Gone Bonkers | 4.80 | 20% | -4.0% | 57% | +3.6% | VALUE |
| 5 | Komito | 5.00 | 18% | -10.0% | 53% | -2.0% | WATCH |
| 4 | Falset Star | 5.00 | 16% | -20.0% | 41% | N/A | PASS |
| 3 | Bayou Music | 11.00 | 10% | +10.0% | 31% | +9.3% | EW_VALUE |
| 8 | Miss Maranda | 12.00 | 8% | -4.0% | 24% | N/A | WATCH |
| 10 | Zuppa Inglese | 15.00 | 7% | +5.0% | 25% | +8.8% | WATCH |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Our Chief (2) comes off a Flemington 2000m win but is short in the market at $3.30 (fair odds $4.17). Jenni Gone Bonkers (1) has exceptional place consistency (89% career) but lacks recent 1800m experience.

**Class**: All 3yos stepping up from maiden/restricted company. Our Chief has the form edge from metro wins but carries 59.5kg. Bayou Music (3) ran a close 2nd over 1800m at Flemington in winter - the only runner with genuine 1800m form.

**Distance**: Critical factor - only Bayou Music and Zuppa Inglese have 1800m race experience. Most runners untried beyond 1600m, creating uncertainty.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - neutral assumed. No significant barrier or style advantage detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Bayou Music** represents genuine each-way value at $11. The only runner with proven 1800m form (2nd at Flemington, beaten 0.25L), getting 1.5kg from favorite. Strong place specialist score (2.79) with 67% career place rate. The EW EV of +9.3% is the best in the field. Craig Williams aboard adds jockey quality.

**Jenni Gone Bonkers** is the ultimate place specialist (1.85 score, 89% place rate) but questionable at 1800m having never raced beyond 1600m. The marginal +3.6% EW EV makes it a secondary consideration only.

**Our Chief** is the quality runner but significantly overbet at $3.30. Despite winning at 2000m last start, the -20.8% edge and -8.4% EW EV make him a clear PASS at current odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Distance query** - Bayou Music's only 1800m run was 6 months ago on soft ground
2. **Track fitness** - Several runners resuming or second-up with limited form lines
3. **Our Chief class** - If he reproduces Flemington form, short-priced runners dominate

## PLACE SPECIALIST ANALYSIS

| Horse | Career Place% | Expected% | Specialist Score |
|-------|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| Jenni Gone Bonkers | 89% | 48% | 1.85 (Strong) |
| Bayou Music | 67% | 24% | 2.79 (Strong) |
| Zuppa Inglese | 80% | 17% | 4.76 (Strong) |

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

- Market %: 123.8% (standard overround)
- Favorite: Our Chief @ $3.30 (implied 30.3%)
- Value detected: Bayou Music (+10% edge), Zuppa Inglese (+5% marginal)
