| 4 | Milford | $13.00 | 8% | +4.0% | 26% | - | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Bold Soul most consistent - 7 wins from 25 starts (28% SR), all 7 wins on good ground. Last start 4th beaten 0.35L in same class at Flemington over this trip - excellent formline reference.

**Class**: BM100 grade suits Bold Soul who has placed in this class recently. Jenni's Meadow ran 2nd in same Flemington BM100 two weeks ago but steps up from BM78 wins.

**Distance**: Bold Soul proven at 2000m (2 wins from 8 starts). Tarvue untested beyond 1800m at metro level. Scary's only 2000m run was a trial.

**Conditions**: Rain forecast but track currently Good 4. Bold Soul excellent on good (7/19 wins), poor on soft (0/6). Monitor if track deteriorates.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Bold Soul represents the best value proposition in this small field. Career 56% place strike rate underpins the each-way angle at $6.00. The form reference from the Flemington BM100 two weeks ago is the standout - same distance, same class, beaten just 0.35L. Michael Dee retains the ride. The 2000m trip is ideal based on two previous wins at the distance. At $6.00 with 1/4 place odds of $2.25, the EW expected value of +17% is compelling.

Jenni's Meadow is the deserving favourite after her Flemington 2nd but the $2.90 offers no value - fair odds closer to $3.60. She's the likely winner but poor betting proposition.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (7) in small field - may need to go back and around
2. Rain forecast - if track deteriorates to Soft, Bold Soul's record is concerning (0/6)
3. Only 13 days between runs at age 5 - fitness should be fine but note quick backup

## MARKET WATCH

- Jenni's Meadow $2.90 (OPPOSE) - 19% underlay, no value
- Bold Soul $6.00 (BET) - 8% overlay with strong EW profile
- Scary $11.00 (WATCH) - 10% edge but 98 days off, first-up query
