## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Enriched has outstanding profile - 33% win rate, 67% place rate from 9 starts. Trialled well 15/01 winning barrier trial at Randwick (51.18s/850m). Last race win at Randwick 1200m (12/04/25) in 69.52s. The Instructor is race fit (13 days since last) with 35% win rate but showed nothing last start at Gold Coast (7th).

**Class**: Group 2 level. Enriched has proven Group quality - won 3YO Open Set Weight at Randwick. The Instructor rises sharply from BM-level country racing (won Scone, Wagga) to metro Group 2. Willaidow has Group-level placings but form figures (8-x-5-7-6) suggest below best.

**Wet Track**: CRITICAL FACTOR. Track Soft 5 with rain. Enriched: 1/3 soft (33%), handles it. Willaidow: 5/10 soft (50%), 1/3 heavy - **WET TRACK SPECIALIST**. Disneck: 0/8 soft, 0/2 heavy - **SIGNIFICANT QUERY**. The Instructor: 3/7 soft (43%) - handles it.

**Barrier**: Small field, barriers less critical. Meridiana (1) and Willaidow (2) well drawn. Enriched (7) and Disneck (8) widest but manageable in 8-horse field.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**ENRICHED** gets the EW call at $6.50. Elite strike rate (33% win, 67% place) from lightly-raced 9-start career shows quality. Fresh-up after 293 days but has trialled twice since September, winning latest at Randwick. Soft track is manageable (1/3 on soft). The M Freedman/T Berry combination is potent at Rosehill. At $6.50, the 16% win probability and 45% place probability deliver +5.6% EW EV - the only genuine value play in the race.

**The Instructor** is market favourite at $4.40 but the price reflects hype over substance. Last start 7th at Gold Coast is concerning. The rise from provincial/country grade to Group 2 metro is significant. No edge at current price.

**Willaidow** is the WET TRACK DANGER with J McDonald aboard and proven soft/heavy form (5/10 on soft, 1/3 heavy). Recent trial win at Warwick Farm on heavy (53.14s) was workmanlike. The 18% win probability isn't quite enough value at $5.50 but include in exotics.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Enriched 293-day spell** - Long absence, relies on trial form
2. **Deteriorating track** - Rain forecast, may shift to Heavy which changes picture (Willaidow improves, Disneck struggles)

## MARKET WATCH

- The Instructor overbacked at $4.40 (fair odds $4.55)
- Enriched fair value at $6.50 (fair odds $6.25)
- Willaidow slight underlay at $5.50 (fair odds $5.56)
- Compelling Truth longshot value at $27 if looking for outsider
