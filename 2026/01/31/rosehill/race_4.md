## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Chilly Girl won impressively on debut (900m Rosehill, Soft), recording 55.28s - the fastest time in the field at the trip. She followed up with 2nd of 10 on Good going.

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected. Several runners with on-pace profiles. Chilly Girl showed tactical speed from barrier 2, can lead or sit handy.

**Class**: Maiden 2YO fillies. Most runners lightly raced with limited form exposure. Chilly Girl's trial form and debut win suggest she's above average for the grade.

**Wet Track**: Soft 5 with rain forecast. Chilly Girl won on Soft - proven form on the going. Miss Scandal untested on soft/heavy. Key query on favourite.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Chilly Girl offers genuine each-way value at $7.50. She won her debut on Soft 5 at this track over 900m, defeating Pearl Of Dubai who ran 4th in that race. The step to 1100m suits as a progressing 2YO, and barrier 2 allows Tim Clark to dictate. The favourite Miss Scandal is untested on soft ground and heavily over-bet at $2.35 (fair odds closer to $5.50 based on form). Chilly Girl's place probability of 46% makes the $2.15 place odds attractive.

**EW Value Path A**: Odds $7.50 >= $6, EW EV +16.6% >= +5%, Place prob 46% >= 30%

## KEY RISKS

1. First start at 1100m (stepping up 200m from debut)
2. Rain may deteriorate track further - currently Soft 5
