## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Incognito dominant, unbeaten from 1 start (won Rosehill 900m debut by 0.19L). Long break (118 days) and first run on Soft track are query marks at prohibitive $1.60.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Confederation and Hidrix have shown positional versatility from trials at 800m. Small field negates wide barriers.

**Class**: All runners lightly raced 2YOs. Incognito has the best prizemoney average ($141k) indicating superior trial/debut form. Eviction Notice impressive trial winner (7.82L).

**Wet Track**: Incognito untested on Soft. Confederation's trial form on Heavy (3rd, 0.30L behind winner) suggests wet track competence. Persian Wonder has Soft win at Rosehill.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Confederation** offers genuine each-way value at $9.50. His two trials were solid: 4th at Warwick Farm (Soft) then 3rd at Warwick Farm (Heavy) beaten just 0.30L. James McDonald booking for debut is a significant positive. Waller-trained 2YO with McDonald up on a wet track at odds is the value angle. EW EV of +25.1% qualifies via Path A (odds >= $6, EW EV >= +5%, place prob >= 30%).

**Why not Incognito?** Despite being the class horse, $1.60 represents -20% edge with fair odds around $2.00. First-up from 118 days, no trial, and untested on Soft ground all add risk that isn't compensated at the price. Professional approach is to oppose at unders.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Incognito too good** - If handles Soft and freshness, class prevails
2. **Debutant form lines unreliable** - Trial form doesn't always translate

## FIELD SUMMARY

| # | Horse | Comment |
|---|-------|---------|
| 1 | Incognito | Class act but short. Untested on Soft, long break |
| 2 | Defensemen | Waller 2YO, moderate form, needs improvement |
| 3 | Persian Wonder | Won trial on Soft but weak race |
| 4 | Eviction Notice | Two trials placings, Waterhouse/Bott, each-way place chance |
| 5 | Written In Munny | Flopped on debut, wide draw |
| 7 | Confederation | J McDonald debut, wet track trials, EW VALUE |
| 8 | Hidrix | Rail draw, Waller, trial form, minor place hope |
