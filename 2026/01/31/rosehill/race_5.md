## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Off The Press has outstanding recent form (1-1-2-1-2-2) with consistent speed; won BM74 at Wagga and BM64 at Kensington in style. Little Beginnings shows solid figures with 2nd at Wyong in the same BM78 class 3 weeks ago.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. #1 Elson Boy and #4 No Drama likely to lead, with Off The Press and Sovereign Hill stalking. Race shape suits on-pace runners who can find cover.

**Class**: Both selections proven at this level. Off The Press rising but coming off dominant country/provincial wins. Little Beginnings ran 2nd to the Wyong BM78 winner - that form is a direct reference.

**Bias**: Track bias unknown (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain - inside barriers should have slight advantage but wide runners can make ground in softer conditions.

## FAVORITE ASSESSMENT

**#10 Sovereign Hill @ $2.40** (32% implied)
- 7 starts: 2 wins, 4 places (57% place rate)
- Last start: Won Canterbury 1250m by 4.8L (Soft) - impressive
- Concerns: Wide barrier (8), limited metro experience, beat weak field last start (5 runners)
- Verdict: **UNDERLAY** - Price doesn't reflect risk. Fair odds $3.12+

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#7 OFF THE PRESS** qualifies via Path A (Value Overlay) + Path B (Place Specialist):
- 16 starts: 6 wins, 10 places (100% place rate in last 6 runs!)
- Place specialist score: 2.98 - STRONG
- Last 6 form: 1-1-2-1-2-2 - exceptional consistency
- EW EV: +16.0% | Place EV: +19.9%
- Wide barrier (11) is the concern but horse is proven off the speed

**#3 LITTLE BEGINNINGS** qualifies via Path A + B:
- 37 starts: 6 wins, 17 places (62% place rate)
- Place specialist score: 2.58 - STRONG
- Ran 2nd in Wyong BM78 on 10/01 - direct class reference
- J McDonald booking is significant (elite jockey)
- Wide barrier (10) offset by proven off-pace style
- EW EV: +16.2% | Place EV: +22.5%

## KEY RISKS

1. **Wet track**: Both EW selections have mixed wet form (Off The Press: 1 from 7 on soft; Little Beginnings: 2 from 12 on soft)
2. **Wide barriers**: Both drawn wide (10, 11) - need luck in running
3. **Sovereign Hill**: If the favorite bounces out and leads/stalks, he could prove too good

## MARKET WATCH

- **Sovereign Hill** shortened from $2.60 to $2.40 - clear market confidence
- **Off The Press** steady at $8.00 - under-rated
- **Expert tips**: 4-way split (2, 5, 7, 10) - no consensus
