## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited speed data available. Form-based assessment favors experienced gallopers over short-priced debutante on wet ground.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Danish Prince and Cryptonic likely to press forward from inside barriers. Iceman versatile mid-field runner can position well.

**Class**: BM72 metro. Attractiveness making significant class rise from provincial maiden with zero soft track experience. Iceman and Kyeema proven at level.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - no adjustment applied. Soft 5 with Rain favors proven wet-trackers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#5 ICEMAN** is the standout wet-tracker in this field. His Heavy form is exceptional (1 win, 5 places from 6 Heavy starts) and he handles Soft (1/9, 3pl). First-up after 132 days but trialled well, and Nash Rawiller engagement is positive. The $10 price offers genuine value against a short-priced favorite (#13 Attractiveness) with zero wet form being tested on a Soft 5 with Rain forecast. Iceman's proven BM72 form at 1400-1600m suggests the 1350m is within scope.

**#9 KYEEMA** offers secondary value at $11. Proven on Soft (2/10, 4pl) with a low draw (barrier 3) and Regan Bayliss up. Won a BM64 on Soft at Kensington and placed at BM72 level. Consistent enough to place in this.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Iceman** - First-up after 132 days; needs to be race-fit despite trial
2. **Attractiveness** - If track improves significantly, the favorite becomes more dangerous
3. **Cryptonic** (Barrier 1, Tommy Berry) - Could sneak a place at $7 if pace suits

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

The favorite **#13 ATTRACTIVENESS** is a calculated risk by the market. While she has quality (33% win rate, Richard Freedman trained), this is a significant class rise from provincial maiden grade AND her first test on Soft. All 3 career runs on Good tracks. At $3.10 (implied 32%), she needs to be closer to 40%+ to represent value given the conditions risk. STRONG UNDERLAY.

**#2 ALABAMA STATE** has James McDonald but wide barrier (13) and poor Soft form (0/5) makes $3.80 too short.
