# Rosehill R6 | 1500m BM94
Fri 31 Jan | 3:30pm | 8r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**VALUE: #8 PIPPIE BEACH @ $7.50 - 0.8u EW**

Cross Tasman is the clear class leader but offers no value at $1.60 (fair odds $1.92). Pippie Beach presents each-way value with strong wet track credentials.

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Cross Tasman (4 wins from 7 starts, 57% SR) dominates on raw ability - won BM78 over 1500m here by 3.26L last start. Progressive 4yo stepping up in grade.

**Class**: Big class rise for Cross Tasman (BM78 to BM94) but form warrants it. Pippie Beach has run creditable races at BM88-94 level.

**Wet Track**: Critical factor on Soft 5. Pippie Beach has outstanding wet form (3 wins, 4 places from 4 heavy track starts - 75% win rate on heavy). Cross Tasman only 1 start on heavy (3rd), but 2 from 3 on soft.

**Barrier**: Cross Tasman draws 7 (mid), Pippie Beach draws 6 (ideal). Amplify draws 2 but has 0 wins from 3 soft track starts - concerning.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Pippie Beach (#8)** offers genuine each-way value at $7.50. The Chris Waller-trained mare has exceptional wet track credentials (75% on heavy, 17% on soft with 67% place rate). She ran 3rd behind Cross Tasman last start, beaten 3.26L in a genuinely-run 1500m on soft. Gets James McDonald (elite booking), draws well in barrier 6, and the $7.50 represents +8.9% EW expected value with 43% place probability.

Cross Tasman deserves favoritism and will likely win, but $1.60 offers 17% negative edge. The risk/reward doesn't justify a bet.

## KEY RISKS

1. Cross Tasman may simply be too good regardless of conditions
2. Pippie Beach yet to win beyond 1400m (1 start at 1500m for 3rd)
3. Rain continuing - track may deteriorate further
