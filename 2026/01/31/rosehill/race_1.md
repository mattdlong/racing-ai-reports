# Rosehill R1 | 1500m BM66
Fri 31 Jan | 12:35pm | 19r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Favorite is short with negative edge; market lacks value across field

## EDGE TABLE

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited timing data at 1500m for key runners. Regal Problem shows solid figures at shorter trips; untested at this distance.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected with even tempo runners. Wide barriers (8, 15, 20) face disadvantage in large 19-runner field. Inside draws (18, 12, 21) advantaged.

**Class**: BM66 metro race. Regal Problem rising from country BM58/CL2 class (significant jump). Hannah's Bridge (50% win rate) and Holy Hell (38% win rate) both stepping up from country company.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW. Soft 5 with rain forecast - wet track specialists favored. Navy Steel (2 from 2 heavy), Hurry Miss (1 from 1 heavy) have wet form.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

### #18 REGAL PROBLEM @ $2.30 (FAV)
- **Form**: 3-2-1-1 (last 4) - improving profile
- **Wet**: 0/3 soft (2 places), 0/0 heavy - CONCERN
- **Class**: Rising from country BM58 to metro BM66
- **Barrier**: 2 - excellent draw in large field
- **Jockey**: Braith Nock (apprentice)
- **Green**: Good draw, progressive form, 80% place rate
- **Red**: Big class rise, unproven on soft, short price
- **Verdict**: Clear talent but $2.30 offers no value. True odds closer to $3.30 based on class/wet unknowns.

### #12 HANNAH'S BRIDGE @ $11
- **Form**: 1-1-1-2 (last 4) - excellent recent form
- **Wet**: 0/1 soft, 1/1 heavy - handles give in ground
- **Class**: Won 3 of last 4, stepping up in grade
- **Barrier**: 4 - good draw
- **Jockey**: Tyler Schiller
- **Green**: In-form, good draw, handles wet
- **Red**: First metro start, untested 1500m
- **Verdict**: Progressive mare, fair value around $11 but unproven at this level.

### #13 HOLY HELL @ $11
- **Form**: 1-2-1-7 (last 4) - competitive
- **Wet**: 0/2 soft (1 place), 0/0 heavy - limited wet data
- **Class**: Won at CL2/BM62 level, stepping up
- **Barrier**: 8 - mid draw OK
- **Jockey**: Tim Clark (elite)
- **Green**: Jockey upgrade, proven at 1600m, 75% place rate
- **Red**: Better on good tracks, soft form query
- **Verdict**: Solid claims with Tim Clark aboard but slight wet concern.

### #21 BRAZEN CRIME @ $17
- **Form**: 1-3-6-4 (last 4) - inconsistent
- **Wet**: 0/1 soft - untested
- **Class**: Won BM58 at Wagga last start
- **Barrier**: 3 - good draw
- **Green**: Good barrier, recent winner
- **Red**: No jockey listed, first metro, soft query
- **Verdict**: Place chance at best in this deeper field.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

This is a tricky race dominated by a short-priced favorite with clear question marks. Regal Problem has progressive form but the jump from country Class 2 to metro BM66 on a soft track she's unproven on is significant. The $2.30 price doesn't compensate for these risks.

The alternatives (Hannah's Bridge, Holy Hell) have merit but are also stepping up in grade with limited metro experience. In a 19-runner field on a deteriorating track, the variance is too high to recommend a bet with confidence.

## KEY RISKS

1. Soft/Heavy track limits form reliability - many runners untested in conditions
2. 19-runner field creates high variability and wide barrier disadvantages
3. Multiple class-risers with limited metro form increases uncertainty
