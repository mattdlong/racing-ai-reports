# Rosehill R10 | 1200m BM78
Fri 31 Jan | 5:55pm | 13r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

Secondary: #1 Signor Tortoni @ $18 - 0.5u EW (wet track specialist)

## EDGE TABLE

| 8 | Agarwood | 7.50 | 41 | 13% | -3% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited speed figure data available. Recent 1200m times suggest Signor Tortoni (72.95s heavy) and Zumbo (67.27s soft) have run competitive figures on rain-affected tracks.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected with multiple on-pacers. Stormland and Signor Tortoni likely to vie for lead. Midfield runners should get clean runs.

**Class**: BM78 metro - competitive field. Signor Tortoni dropping from open class barrier trials, Zumbo rising from BM72 after solid third (0.63L margin).

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - neutral assumed. Soft 5 with rain favors proven wet trackers.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#11 ZUMBO** offers the best value at $9.50. Strong wet track credentials (2w/4p from 4 starts on soft/heavy), proven at metro level with runner-up to Oxenham in Highway and showed fight when third at this track 13 days ago. Tommy Berry booking adds confidence. The $9.50 represents +33% edge against a 14% win probability.

**#1 SIGNOR TORTONI** is the wet track specialist longshot. Outstanding record on affected ground (3w/7p from 7 starts on soft/heavy) with recent easy trial win at 1050m Randwick. The wide barrier (14) is a concern but his explosive speed can overcome it. At $18, the +80% edge on a 10% win probability warrants a small EW play.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Zumbo**: Stepping up from provincial/Highway class; untested at 1200m Rosehill
2. **Signor Tortoni**: Wide barrier 14, first run in 34 days, must handle metro BM78

## MARKET FAVORITE ASSESSMENT

**#13 Nepo Baby** ($5.50 fav) - 2-from-2 but both wins at provincial level (Scone, Hawkesbury). First metro Saturday start, first run in 127 days, no soft/heavy form. Class rise + fitness query = PASS despite obvious ability.

## WET TRACK FORM SUMMARY

| # | Horse | Soft/Heavy Record | Assessment |
|---|-------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | Signor Tortoni | 3w/7p from 7 | ELITE |
| 11 | Zumbo | 2w/4p from 4 | PROVEN |
| 4 | Stormland | 2w/4p from 5 | PROVEN |
| 8 | Agarwood | 2w/2p from 3 | PROVEN |
| 3 | Eagle Express | 1w/4p from 6 | HANDLES |
| 13 | Nepo Baby | 0w/0p from 0 | UNTESTED |
