| 1 | Gravina | 2 | $51.00 | 2% | - | 8% | PASS | 258 days off |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Roselyn's Star (75% career place rate) is prohibitive favorite but $2.15 offers no value. Eye Of The Fire won last start at 1100m Randwick (Soft), steps up to 1200m with proven wet form (3 wins from 10 soft track starts). Mogo Magic 60% career place rate, excels on soft (4 wins from 11 soft starts), good inside barrier.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No confirmed leaders; Iron Man and Gravina likely to press. Eye Of The Fire settles midfield, Mogo Magic can sit handy from barrier 3. Shape suits on-pace runners.

**Class**: BM88 metro standard. Eye Of The Fire rising from BM78 win - progressive type. Iron Man won CL4 country last start - class rise query. Sixties has Group form but returning from 125-day break at wrong distance.

**Track/Conditions**: Soft 5 with rain forecast. Favors proven wet-trackers: Eye Of The Fire (3/10 soft), Mogo Magic (4/11 soft), Gravina (4/20 soft). Roselyn's Star 0/3 on soft - concern.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#3 Eye Of The Fire** offers genuine each-way value at $9.00. Last-start winner at Randwick on soft ground (1100m, BM78), now stepping up to 1200m where he has a 1/9 record but consistently hits the frame. The 57% career place rate translates to place specialist score of 1.98. Rising through grades progressively with Jack Callan retaining the ride. EW EV of +5.7% justified.

**#7 Mogo Magic** represents the best overlay in the race at $15.00 (+20% edge). Inside barrier (3) suits his racing pattern. Strong place specialist score of 3.13 with 60% career place rate (12 placings from 20 starts). Excels on soft ground (4 wins, 7 places from 11 soft starts). Jason Collett aboard. EW EV of +18.5% is compelling.

**Favorite Assessment**: Roselyn's Star has the class but $2.15 is far too short. Implied probability 46.5% but true probability closer to 32% based on class rise to BM88, first Sydney metro test at 1200m, and 0/3 on soft ground. Clear underlay.

## KEY RISKS

1. Eye Of The Fire untested at BM88 level - may find this too strong
2. Mogo Magic wide barrier history mixed - prefers inside draws
3. Rain could intensify - track may deteriorate to Heavy favoring Semillion (2/5 Heavy)

## PLACE SPECIALIST DATA

| Horse | Career Place% | Specialist Score | Rating |
|-------|---------------|------------------|--------|
| Mogo Magic | 60% | 3.13 | STRONG |
| Iron Man | 56% | 2.32 | STRONG |
| Eye Of The Fire | 57% | 1.98 | STRONG |
| Gravina | 50% | 1.67 | MODERATE |
