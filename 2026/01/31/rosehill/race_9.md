**Scratchings**: #6 Akkadian Emperor, #11 Wagga Wagga

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Willie Oppa (7) comes off dominant 1800m BM72 win at Kensington (2.24L), but first try at 2000m is a query. Existential Bob (8) 2nd in BM78 2000m at Randwick 3/1 - proven at trip. Placid Pearl (9) won same race. Cormac T (2) ultra-consistent placer - 2nd five times from last 10 starts including over 2000m.

**Class**: BM78 metro. Willie Oppa rising from BM72 win. Existential Bob, Placid Pearl both proven at level. Cormac T placed at BM78 consistently but yet to break through.

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected. No confirmed on-pace runners; Casino Bear (4) may roll forward from barrier 4. Willie Oppa likely to settle midfield and be produced late. Soft 5 track may favor on-pacers.

**Conditions**: Soft 5, rain forecast. Existential Bob has 2 wins from 2 heavy track starts - wet track specialist. Willie Oppa 1/4 soft (limited sample). Cormac T 2/10 soft, handles it. Harlow Mist 2/9 soft - capable.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Cormac T (#2)** qualifies as EACH-WAY VALUE via Path B (Place Specialist). Career record of 4 wins, 16 places from 22 starts (73% place rate) is exceptional. The place specialist score of 3.44 indicates he places 3.4x more than expected given his win rate. Has been runner-up in five of last ten starts including over 2000m at Rosehill (124.67s). Barrier 3 is ideal, and while win probability is modest (~10%), place probability of 35% at $2.38 place odds offers marginal value.

The favorite **Willie Oppa (#7)** is the class act with J McDonald aboard and the Waller factor, but $3.00 is short given he's untested at 2000m and faces proven stayers.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Cormac T**: May lack the turn of foot to win - career suggests he's a professional placegetter
2. **Willie Oppa**: First time 2000m, unknown if stays; mid-barrier 9 requires cover in small field
3. **Track conditions**: Soft 5 with rain - could deteriorate to heavy, favoring wet-trackers like Existential Bob
