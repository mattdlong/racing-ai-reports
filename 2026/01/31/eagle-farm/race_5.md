## ANALYSIS

**Pace**: FAST/CONTESTED - Multiple speed runners (Earn To Burn, Miss Force, Get Ready Lass) should ensure genuine tempo. Short 1000m sprint favors on-pace types.

**Class**: BM68 - Earn To Burn won this grade last start by 4.6L on Soft. Sunrays drops from 3Y Hcp class after 146-day spell with two solid trials. Miss Force rising through grades quickly (2 from 3).

**Wet Track**: Critical factor on Soft 5 with rain. Key form:
- Earn To Burn: 3/5 wins on Soft (60%) - excellent
- Sunrays: 3/3 wins on Soft (100%) - standout wet tracker
- Miss Force: 1/2 on Soft with places - handles it
- Blitzburg: 0/3 on Soft/Heavy - significant query

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence. Rail position unknown. Assume neutral - inside barriers slight advantage in sprint.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Miss Force (#8)** qualifies as EACH-WAY VALUE via Path B (Place Specialist):
- Specialist score 4.17 (100% career place rate from 3 starts)
- Barrier 1 crucial advantage in 1000m sprint
- Won at Eagle Farm 1000m on Soft (57.81s) - course/distance winner
- Rising through grades quickly - 2 wins from 3 career starts
- $9.00 offers value for place at $2.38

The favorite **Earn To Burn** rates clear top pick (38% win prob, score 48.7) but at $2.10 represents no value (-20% edge). Deserved favorite off dominant 4.6L win but market has overcorrected.

**Sunrays** is the danger with perfect wet track record but 146-day spell and wide barrier (8) are concerns despite two encouraging trials. Worth including in exotic plays.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Miss Force** - Rising sharply in class; may find this grade tough to win
2. **Sunrays** - First-up off 146 days; fitness query despite trials
3. **Earn To Burn** - Short-priced favorite vulnerable if not on speed
4. **Weather** - Continued rain could further deteriorate track to Heavy

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Market % | 127.4% (high overround) |
| Favorite | #3 Earn To Burn $2.10 (47.6% implied) |
| True Favorite Prob | ~38% (9.6% edge to bookmaker) |
| Value | No win value; EW value on #8 |
