## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Mickey's Medal (FAV) consistent placegetter at higher grades (BM88-BM100) but 0/7 at 1600m and struggled last start. Edited By won BM78 on Heavy and drops back from BM90 but wide barrier concern. Redford only had 6 days since last run - short backup after poor run.

**Class**: Race competitive BM78. Mickey's Medal dropping from BM100/BM94 is the class horse but has questions. Edited By's BM78 win came on Heavy at Rosehill - different conditions. Zoology ran 3rd in BM85 and won BM78 at 2000m - handles the grade.

**Track/Going**: Soft 5 with rain. Zoology 1/6 soft with 3 places - handles cut. Living Free 2/12 soft with 5 places - proven wet tracker. Mickey's Medal 2/14 soft with 8 places - excellent wet form. Redford 2/3 soft - solid.

**Barrier**: Living Free (2) and Mickey's Medal (1) have the rails draws. Redford (5) and Zoology (6) mid draws fine. Edited By (9) wide draw problematic in wet conditions.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Zoology (#5)** - The 12/1 looks overs for a horse that ran 3rd in BM85 company (Doomben 25/6/25) and won BM78 at 2000m. Has 4 wins from 22 starts (18% SR) and 41% place rate showing consistency. Handles the wet (1/6, 3pl soft), has course experience (4 starts, 1 win), and Ben Thompson in the saddle is a booking upgrade. The step back from 2000m to 1600m suits - has tactical speed. At $12 each-way with 35% place probability, offers +37.6% EW EV.

**Living Free (#6)** - The inside barrier (2) is golden on a wet Eagle Farm. Consistent type with 7 wins from 28 starts (25% SR) and excellent 46% place rate. Form reads well - trialled up nicely (3rd 27/1), previously 4th in this grade at Eagle Farm (20/12) beaten 0.2L. Proven soft tracker (2/12, 5pl). At $12 with 31% place probability, offers +18.1% EW EV. The inside draw gives him every chance to settle handy without using petrol.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Mickey's Medal (#7)** is the class drop horse with elite wet form (2/14, 8pl soft) - if he bounces back from last start failure, he's hard to beat from barrier 1
2. **Soft 5 to Heavy upgrade** - if track deteriorates further, could see frontrunners struggle and favour deep closers
3. **Edited By (#4)** has the Michael Freedman polish and won impressively last prep - wide draw the main concern

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

The favourite Mickey's Medal at $2.70 implies 37% win probability but has 0/7 record at 1600m and failed last start in a weaker MM Cup. The market has overreacted to his class drop. Edited By at $3.40 looks short given wide barrier in wet conditions. Redford at $3.50 on 6-day backup after a poor run is risky.

The value lies with Zoology and Living Free at $12 - both have superior EW value profiles with proven wet form and good draws.
