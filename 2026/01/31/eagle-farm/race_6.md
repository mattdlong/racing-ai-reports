## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|------|--------|------|
| 6 | Rezone | 3 | 3.70 | 22% | -19% | 52% | PASS |
| 2 | Ramp It Up | 13 | 4.60 | 16% | -26% | 38% | PASS |
| 5 | Headhunter | 1 | 7.00 | 14% | -2% | 36% | WATCH |
| 4 | Eclair Awesome | 9 | 8.50 | 14% | +19% | 36% | VALUE |
| 17 | Sanctuary Storm | 15 | 12.00 | 8% | -4% | 25% | EW VALUE |
| 3 | Detrimental | 11 | 12.00 | 10% | +10% | 29% | WATCH |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Headhunter (98.42s/1630m last start) and Eclair Awesome (96.99s/1600m) have best recent figures at the trip. Rezone's wins came at 1400m on good ground.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected with no confirmed leaders. Ramp It Up and Sanctuary Storm likely to settle midfield. Headhunter from barrier 1 can control position.

**Class**: BM78 metro. Eclair Awesome rises from BM70 with 4 wins from 9 starts (44% strike rate). Sanctuary Storm steps up from BM70/CL3 level but has consistent placings.

**Bias**: Track bias unknown (LOW confidence). Soft 5 with rain - favour horses with proven wet form.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#4 Eclair Awesome** offers the best value in the race at $8.50. Outstanding soft track record (4 wins, 5 places from 7 soft starts = 71% ITM). The 44% career strike rate and 67% place rate suggest a horse that finds a way to be competitive. Rising in class but has won 4 from 9 - quality is there. Barrier 9 manageable with even tempo. EW Edge: +11.2%.

**#17 Sanctuary Storm** is a PLACE SPECIALIST with 62% career place rate (8 places from 13 starts). While win probability is lower at $12, the Path B criteria qualifies via specialist score (3.67). Form reads 4-3-2-1-2-3 (last 6 = 5 places). Course form (0/3 wins but 1 place from 3 at Eagle Farm 1600m). EW bet captures the place value.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Eclair Awesome**: Wide barrier (9) in 15-runner field on rain-affected track
2. **Sanctuary Storm**: Wide barrier (15), first-up at this distance, no course wins
3. **Market leader Rezone**: Overbet at $3.70 (-19% edge) but back-to-back 1400m wins give form credentials

## WHY NOT THE FAVORITE?

**#6 Rezone @ $3.70** - Back-to-back wins impressive but:
- Both wins at 1400m (stepping up to 1600m)
- Going record on soft: 2 wins, 2 places from 7 starts (29% win rate vs 50% on good)
- Market price implies 27% win prob but analysis suggests ~22%
- Barrier 3 is positive but -19% edge makes this an UNDERLAY

## SCRATCHINGS

- #7 Caracoron (scratched)
- #9 Call Me Legend (scratched)
