**Scratched**: #3 Earn To Burn, #8 Star Rapper

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Larado (2-3-3, 100% place rate) is the clear class runner, winning last at Sunshine Coast by 1.8L. Lightly raced 4yo with upside. Spiethtacular has strong placing form but untested against this class.

**Pace**: CONTESTED - Multiple speed horses (Concession, Provance) should ensure honest tempo. Larado has tactical speed from barrier 1 and should get cover or lead.

**Class**: BM70 sprint with several horses rising in grade. Larado won CL1 last start and steps up appropriately. Savagery Vibe and Metalcraft face their toughest test.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - no reliable data. Soft 5 track with rain forecast favors proven wet-trackers. Larado (1-1-1 soft), Provance (3-4-7 soft), and Custo (3-5-12 soft) have the best wet form.

**Barriers**: Larado draws ideally in 1, should control race. Spiethtacular (2) and Just Precious (4) also well placed. Wide draws (Provance 11, Super Zamboni 10, Big Boy George 9) are problematic at 1000m.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#9 LARADO ($2.35)** - Clear top pick on ability. Won maiden by 3.8L then placed at EF in CL1 before dominant 1.8L win last start. Only 3 career starts, 67% win rate, 100% place rate. Barrier 1 ideal. The query is price - $2.35 implies 42.5% win probability but true probability closer to 34% after adjusting for overround. SHORT PRICE but most likely winner.

**#11 SPIETHTACULAR ($2.90)** - Tony Gollan-trained mare with 88% place rate (7/8). Won 3 from 8 but beaten 0.6L at EF last start. Barrier 2 suits. Issue: has not won on soft ground (0/2) and may be overbet due to trainer reputation. OPPOSE at this price.

**#12 METALCRAFT ($12.00)** - Progressive 3yo off solid 1.6L win at Ipswich. Lightest weight (55.5kg) is a plus. Untested at Eagle Farm and this class but thrives on soft (2/3). Each-way prospect if you want to play against favorite.

**#10 SAVAGERY VIBE ($6.00)** - Gollan-trained mare making QLD return after southern campaign. Placed at Ipswich last start. First run at Eagle Farm is a concern. Needs to improve.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Larado under odds** - True probability ~34% vs implied 42.5%. No betting edge.
2. **Soft track** - Rain forecast may worsen conditions. Horses without wet form at risk.
3. **Wide barriers** - Barrier 9-11 draws are significant disadvantage at 1000m sprint.

## VERDICT

Larado should win this but is under odds at $2.35. The market has correctly identified the class runner but compressed the price too tight. Spiethtacular at $2.90 is poor value - better place horse than win chance.

If forced to bet, **METALCRAFT each-way at $12** offers some interest as a progressive type at light weight, but this is a low-conviction play.

**Recommended**: PASS or small saver on Metalcraft E/W.
