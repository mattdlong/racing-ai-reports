Place Specialist (4.46 score) | Path A+B qualified | +8.8% EW EV | +21.5% Place EV

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Compel ($2) dominated trial form, beaten 0.18L at Doomben. Lonesome Star won Warwick trial by 3.83L but stepping up 400m. I'lltellyouanytime only horse with race experience (4 starts, 2 places).

**Class**: All runners are 2YO debutants or lightly raced. Step up to metro Eagle Farm is significant test for country-trialed horses.

**Pace**: No sectional data available. Expect Lonesome Star and Compel to contest early given trial performances. Small field should produce moderate tempo.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW - no significant adjustment applied. Soft 5 suits those with wet track form.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Nifty's Treasure** qualifies for EW via dual pathways:
- **Path A (Value Overlay)**: $12 odds, +8.8% EW EV, 32% place probability
- **Path B (Place Specialist)**: 100% place rate (3rd both career starts), specialist score 4.46

The filly has shown consistent placing ability at Doomben (3rd, 5.1L behind winner) and Toowoomba (3rd, 0.21L). While lacking win ability, the place terms at $3.75 offer +21.5% EV. Barrier 3 is ideal in small field.

**No Best Bet**: Market leader Compel is skinny at $2 (fair odds $2.63). Lonesome Star untested at 1200m after 800m trial. Insufficient edge on any runner for win bet.

## KEY RISKS

1. First start at Eagle Farm - metro intensity step up
2. No wet track form (both starts on Good) - Soft 5 is unknown
3. Olivia Webb apprentice claim - limited metro experience

## CONTENDER NOTES

**Compel (#2)** - Clear market elect. Munce stable reliable with 2YOs. Trial form excellent but $2 offers no value. Fair odds $2.63.

**Lonesome Star (#3)** - Impressive 3.83L trial win but at 800m. The 400m step up at first start is risky. Barrier 5 OK.

**I'lltellyouanytime (#5)** - Most exposed, 4 starts for 2 places. Ran 2nd at Doomben 17/01 but beaten 5.1L. Honest type, place chance.
