## ANALYSIS

**Form**: War King (#4) strongest recent form with 2nd in CL1 at this track/distance; North Pole (#2) has best consistency (90% place rate) but untested at 1600m.

**Class**: Field mostly recent maiden winners stepping up. Crash The Party (#3) concerning - 0 wins from 8 despite $3.60 odds; market overrating.

**Wet Track**: Critical factor on Soft 5. Valouri 1-2 from 2 on soft; North Pole 1-2 from 4 on soft; War King only 1-1 on soft (won maiden). The Bear (#1) poor wet tracker (0-0 from 3 soft/heavy).

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected with no genuine leaders. Should suit on-pace runners.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Valouri (#10)** offers genuine each-way value at $21/$4.00. This filly has placed in all 4 career starts (100% consistency), won her maiden impressively on soft at 1400m, and handles wet ground. The step to 1600m is a query but trainer Matthew Dunn is astute with stayers. At these odds, the place probability (~23%) versus $4.00 place odds delivers +36% place EV.

The market favorites are hard to oppose on form but offer no value. War King is correctly rated #1 but $2.90 implies 34% when form suggests 26%. North Pole is the value among the fancied runners but still short at $3.40.

## KEY RISKS

1. First try at 1600m - all her runs have been 1400m or shorter
2. Wide barrier (6) but not critical in 13-horse field on spacious Eagle Farm track
3. Metro class rise from Ballina/regional wins

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

- **War King** $2.90: Justified favorite, no value (-25% edge)
- **North Pole** $3.40: Danger, slight underlay (-32% edge)
- **Crash The Party** $3.60: False favorite, 0/8 career wins, avoid
- **Valouri** $21.00: Value play, 100% place rate supports EW
