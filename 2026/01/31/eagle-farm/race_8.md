**Scratchings**: #3 Mickey's Medal, #4 Redford

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Atmosphere comes in with solid form (x71431) including recent win at Ipswich 1350m. 55% career place rate with proven soft track record (2 wins, 7 places from 10 starts on soft).

**Class**: Rising from CL5/HCP level to BM85 but has prior BM85 experience. Castillian resuming from 155 days but showed good trial form (3rd in trial 12 Jan).

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Battlefield and Castillian likely to press forward from wide draws. Atmosphere drawn barrier 3 can settle midfield with cover.

**Conditions**: Soft 5 with rain - suits Atmosphere (20% win, 90% place from 10 soft track runs). Battlefield has poor soft form (0/4) which is a concern at short odds.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Atmosphere presents genuine each-way value at $10. The 6yo gelding has a 74% career place rate (23 places from 31 starts) - a **STRONG PLACE SPECIALIST** score of 2.57. His soft track record is excellent and he's drawn to get the right run in barrier 3. The hot favorite Battlefield ($2.70) is vulnerable - wide draw (10), backing up 6 days, and concerning soft track record (0 wins from 4 soft starts). At the price differential, Atmosphere offers superior risk/reward.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise to BM85 - needs to handle the grade
2. First run at Eagle Farm 1400m (0/2 at course, but 4/17 at 1400m)
3. 44 days since last start (trialled well though)

## MARKET ANALYSIS

- Market %: 124.5% (standard over-round)
- Favorite: #2 Battlefield @ $2.70 (implied 37%)
- Value detected: #1 Atmosphere +20% edge
