**Scratchings**: #9 Mean Approach, #12 Amore Veloce, #13 Big Boy George, #15 Meldubious

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited recent 1200m speed figures available. True Amor's 70.18 at Beaumont (BM64 win) sets class benchmark.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Sir Carter (#1) and Invahir (#2) likely to contest early. True Amor can stalk from barrier 2.

**Class**: BM65 - True Amor dropping from CL4 level wins is the class act. Invahir competitive at OPEN level country.

**Bias**: Track bias unknown - no adjustment applied. Soft 5 conditions suit Invahir (3 wins from 8 soft track starts, 38%).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Invahir (#2)** qualifies as EW VALUE via Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist):
- Place specialist score: 2.875 (STRONG) - career 69% place rate vs 24% expected
- 31% place probability with $13 win odds = +29% EW expected value
- Proven soft track performer (3/8 wins, 5/8 places on soft)
- Won last start at Warwick by 2.6L, placed 3rd in BM78 at Doomben 14/01
- Trainer Pat Webster has stable in form

**True Amor (#11)** is the most likely winner but offers no value at $2.10:
- Implied 48% vs estimated 32% win probability = -26% edge (UNDERLAY)
- Recent 2nd at Gold Coast beaten 0.02L shows ability
- First run in QLD but Munce stable well-credentialed
- Barrier 2 ideal for soft track, can sit and sprint

## KEY RISKS

1. **Invahir**: Wide barrier 9 will need luck from midfield; rises in class from country level
2. **True Amor**: First QLD start; short price offers no protection if beaten

## MARKET WATCH

True Amor has been heavily supported ($2.10 clear favorite). If drifts beyond $2.80, may present value. Invahir at $13+ remains the value play.
