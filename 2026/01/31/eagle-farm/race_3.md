# Eagle Farm R3 | 1810m BM90
Fri 31 Jan | 2:28pm | 10r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**VALUE: #3 WAPITI @ $17 - 0.8u EW**
**VALUE: #1 GALIFIANAKIS @ $12 - 0.6u EW**

## KEY INSIGHT: WET TRACK ELIMINATES FAVORITES

The $1.90 favorite **Brindavan** has 0/2 on soft, never tried heavy. Second favorite **Akkadian Emperor** ($3.50) has 0/9 on soft. Both are vulnerable on the deteriorating Soft 5 track with rain forecast.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Wet Rec | Tier |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|---------|------|
| 2 | Brindavan | 7 | $1.90 | 25% | 62% | -52% | 0/2 | PASS |
| 8 | Akkadian Emperor | 2 | $3.50 | 15% | 42% | -37% | 0/9 | PASS |
| 7 | Noble Conqueror | 4 | $8.50 | 10% | 30% | +2% | 0/14 | WATCH |
| 1 | Galifianakis | 11 | $12 | 12% | 32% | +44% | 3/19 | VALUE |
| 3 | Wapiti | 10 | $17 | 10% | 28% | +70% | 3/30 | VALUE |
| 4 | That's Molly | 3 | $18 | 6% | 18% | -28% | 6/22 | WATCH |
| 5 | Cape Crusader | 6 | $31 | 4% | 12% | -7% | 2/8 | PASS |
| 9 | Wowit's Willywonka | 8 | $26 | 4% | 14% | - | 2/8 | PASS |
| 10 | Caracoron | 9 | $41 | 3% | 10% | - | 3/8 | PASS |
| 11 | Let Fly | 5 | $27 | 3% | 12% | - | 2/11 | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No reliable speed figures - distance/class shifts make comparisons difficult. Akkadian Emperor best stayer on paper but untested on soft.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Galifianakis and Wapiti typically race on-speed/handy. Brindavan showed good tactical speed last start but was on Good ground.

**Class**: BM90 is strong provincial level. Brindavan rising from BM78 win - significant jump. Galifianakis has class rating for this level. Wapiti consistent at BM85-90.

**Track Bias**: Soft 5 with rain - track likely to deteriorate further. Inside barriers advantaged. Wide draws (10, 11) face challenges.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

### #3 WAPITI @ $17 EW

Veteran stayer with **excellent wet track credentials**: 1/23 soft (10 places), 2/7 heavy (2 places). At 9yo still competitive at BM78-90 level. Has 19 starts at Eagle Farm (2 wins), knows the track. Recent form includes 2nd at Sunshine Coast on Soft 5 (BM78) and 3rd at Eagle Farm (BM85). Wide barrier (10) is the concern but wet tracks favor on-pace runners who can dictate.

**Green Lights**: Proven wet tracker, C/D experience, honest place record (43% career)
**Red Flags**: Wide barrier, 9yo, beaten last start

### #1 GALIFIANAKIS @ $12 EW

8yo with **solid wet form**: 2/15 soft, 1/4 heavy. Has 11 starts at Eagle Farm (2 wins). Second at this track over 1800m two starts back. Form reads 456527 - patchy but the 2nd was at this track/distance on Good. Gets up to weight (63kg) but that's standard for his class. Wide barrier (11) is problematic.

**Green Lights**: Wet tracker, Eagle Farm winner, consistent placer (49% career)
**Red Flags**: Wide barrier, 8yo, form pattern declining

## WHY OPPOSE THE FAVORITE

**Brindavan ($1.90)** is a Gollan-trained 4yo rising sharply from a BM78 win. His wet track record is **0 for 2 on soft with no placings**. He showed promise in UK before returning but those performances were all on good/fast ground. At $1.90 implied probability of 53%, the market is ignoring the wet track risk. Fair odds should be $4.00+ given the conditions.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Wide barriers**: Both selections draw wide (10, 11) - if the track plays to inside runners, they may struggle for position
2. **Favorite can handle soft**: Brindavan's two soft runs were early in career - he may have improved
3. **Class rise for Wapiti**: Last ran in MM Trophy (Listed equivalent) - struggled in that grade

## BETTING SUMMARY

| Selection | Bet Type | Odds | Stake | Target Return |
|-----------|----------|------|-------|---------------|
| #3 Wapiti | Each-Way | $17/$3.60 | 0.8u | Win: 13.6u / Place: 2.9u |
| #1 Galifianakis | Each-Way | $12/$2.75 | 0.6u | Win: 7.2u / Place: 1.7u |

**Total Outlay**: 2.8u (1.4u × 2 for E/W)
