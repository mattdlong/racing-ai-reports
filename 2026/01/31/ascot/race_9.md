## ANALYSIS

**Form**: De Grandhomme (3-1-4-1-1-2) is the most consistent runner, 5 wins from 14 starts (36%) with 64% place rate. Too Darn Stormy is talented but untested over 1100m with only 2 career starts.

**Pace**: MODERATE pace expected. No obvious leaders - De Grandhomme typically races on-pace from barrier 2, while Too Darn Stormy (barrier 3) will likely settle midfield.

**Class**: BM68 level. De Grandhomme won GRAD HCP 60+ last start, slight class rise. Too Darn Stormy stepping up from trials into competitive company first-up after 237-day break.

**Conditions**: Soft 5 track is the key query. De Grandhomme has limited soft track form (1 start, 0 wins, 0 places). Too Darn Stormy untested on soft. Lucky I Am (2 wins from 5 soft) and Avoidance (2 wins from 4 soft) suit these conditions best.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

De Grandhomme represents outstanding each-way value at $10. Qualifies via Path A (odds $10+, EW EV +17.2%, place prob 35%) AND Path B (place specialist score 2.22). The horse's 64% career place rate vs 12% implied win probability creates significant overlay. While soft track form is a concern, the value compensates for this risk. Too Darn Stormy is the class horse but significantly overbacked at $2.30 given first-up off 237 days at a new distance on an untested surface.

## KEY RISKS

1. Soft 5 track - De Grandhomme 0 from 1 on soft, major query
2. Too Darn Stormy has superior class and elite jockey (W Pike)
