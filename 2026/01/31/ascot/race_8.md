## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Redback Flyer won impressively at 1400m last start (06/12), stepping up to 1600m where he's 2/4 at Ascot. Has W. Pike booked - elite jockey engagement. Ginger Green is a consistent placer (49% career strike rate) suited to wet tracks (4 wins, 8 places from 16 soft starts).

**Class**: BM66 suits both selections. Redback Flyer (40% win rate) has quality at this level. Ginger Green competitive in RTG 66-72 grade throughout prep.

**Conditions**: Soft 5 track is a key factor. Redback Flyer has 1 win from 1 soft start (100%). Ginger Green has proven soft track ability (4/16 wins, 50% place rate). Cashel Palace has ZERO soft track wins (0/1) - significant query.

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected with no confirmed speed. Dennis Choux and Desennea likely to press forward. Redback Flyer settles midfield, Ginger Green runs on from back.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#6 REDBACK FLYER** rates top chance at $3.80. Elite jockey W. Pike booked, proven at course (2/4 wins at Ascot), rising progressive type with 4 wins from 10 starts (40%). The step to 1600m is manageable given he ran 4th over the trip last start behind eventual G3 placegetter. Place probability of 76% based on 90% career placing rate makes EW compelling at 1/4 odds (EW EV: +18%).

**#4 GINGER GREEN** offers genuine EW value at $10. Strong place specialist score (2.21) with 64% actual place rate vs 29% expected. Has run consistently all prep (3-4-2-4-3-7) and handles soft tracks well. At $10, the +20% edge on win component plus +14.4% place EV qualifies via Path A criteria.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Redback Flyer**: 41 days between runs - fitness query on soft track
2. **Ginger Green**: Wide barrier (7) and needs tempo to run on

## GREEN/RED FLAGS

**Redback Flyer (6)**
- [+] Elite jockey W. Pike engaged
- [+] Proven C/D record (2/4 Ascot, 2/4 at 1600m)
- [+] 40% career win strike rate
- [-] Returning from 41-day spell

**Ginger Green (4)**
- [+] Strong place specialist (2.21 score)
- [+] Excellent wet track form (4/16 soft wins)
