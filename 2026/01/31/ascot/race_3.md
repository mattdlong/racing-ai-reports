## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Daryte posted 59.1s winning by 3.14L at Ascot 1000m - clearly superior figure. Ran 0.6s faster than anything else in the field. Stepping up 100m today suits.

**Pace**: FAST expected - multiple runners with early speed (Daryte, Here The Boom, Farnova). Daryte has tactical speed from barrier 1 to control tempo. William Pike booking adds tactical flexibility.

**Class**: All juveniles, first-up or lightly raced. Daryte only proven winner at race level (2YO SWP). Others are trial winners or placers only.

**Bias**: Soft 5 track + Rain forecast. Daryte untested on wet but breeding suggests handles. Inside barriers advantaged in rain.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Daryte** is a standout 2YO with superior race-day form - won by 3.14L posting 59.1s at Ascot. William Pike aboard, barrier 1, 13-day freshness. However, $1.70 offers no value. Fair odds ~$1.90. Market has priced correctly.

**Farnova** ran 2nd to Daryte, beaten 3.14L. At $7.00, needs Daryte to fail. No independent value case.

**Here The Boom** (barrier 2, trial form only) and **Maria Lucia** (wide draw, slower trial) are too raw for genuine each-way consideration.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Wet track unknown** - No runner has soft/heavy form; all trialled/raced on Good
2. **2YO volatility** - Juveniles unpredictable; one poor jump changes everything
3. **Wide draws** - Barriers 10-14 disadvantaged if track deteriorates further
