## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Sonoftheboss won last start at this C/D (70.87s), drops to suitable BM66 grade. Fancy Red exceptional 91% place rate (10/11 career placings) with Pike up from barrier 1.

**Class**: Horcrux resuming after 174 days off a trial win - fitness query despite talent. Urquharts Bluff 3 wins from 9 but lacks metro BM66 credentials and soft track record (0/2).

**Wet Track**: Sonoftheboss 1-3 from 4 on soft (25%/100%), proven. Fancy Red 1-4 from 4 on soft. Supernatural 0-2 from 5 on soft - significant concern. Snow Prince 0-2 from 8 on soft.

**Pace**: Moderate tempo expected. Sonoftheboss (22 course starts) and Snow Prince typically forward. Fancy Red (Pike) can dictate from barrier 1.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#1 SONOFTHEBOSS** offers genuine value at $5.50. Last start winner over this course and distance (1200m Ascot), now racing in identical BM66 grade. Strong wet track credentials (1 win, 3 places from 4 soft starts). Excellent course record (3 wins, 13 places from 22 starts). The 21% edge with 58% place probability makes EW the optimal play. Only concern is barrier 6 which requires cover.

**#3 FANCY RED** is the standout place bet. Phenomenal 91% career place rate (10 places from 11 starts) with William Pike aboard from barrier 1. No win value (-1.2% edge) but 72% place probability at $1.50 place odds delivers +21.5% place EV. Place specialist score of 1.46 confirms EW suitability. First run at 1200m Ascot but class appears sufficient.

## KEY RISKS

1. Soft 5 track may deteriorate further with rain forecast - monitor conditions
2. Horcrux ($3.10 fav) has ability if fitness holds first-up after 174 days
3. Fancy Red untested at this C/D (1/1 course, 0/1 distance at 1200m)

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market favors Horcrux ($3.10) despite long layoff - risky proposition. Fancy Red ($3.80) fairly weighted on ability but place value exceeds win value. Sonoftheboss ($5.50) underrated given last start C/D win and wet track form. Urquharts Bluff ($10) tempting on recent form but 0/2 on soft tracks.
