## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Sound Of Speed won last start at Ascot (1000m) by 0.88L, fresh off 29-day break. Career record 2-5 from 7 starts with 100% place rate - exceptional consistency.

**Class**: CL1 level appropriate for recent winners stepping up. Sound Of Speed handles the class having placed at this level in two previous runs.

**Conditions**: Soft 5 track is the key variable. Sound Of Speed has 1-1 record on soft tracks (Bunbury MDN win), while main rivals Twisted Steel and Aberdeen Flyer are unproven on rain-affected going.

**Pace**: Small field of 8 should produce MODERATE tempo. Sound Of Speed typically races on-pace from barrier 2 - ideal to avoid traffic and sit handy.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Sound Of Speed offers the best risk-adjusted value in this field. The William Pike booking is significant - he's WA's premier jockey and doesn't ride many CL1 races unless confident. The 100% career place rate (7 from 7) makes the EW component compelling at $5.50 with +16.6% combined EV. While Twisted Steel has stronger recent form, the $3.90 odds provide no value (-14.2% edge). Reconnaissance at $8 shows +12% edge but returns from 57-day break with no soft track form - uncertain first-up. Sound Of Speed's wet track experience and elite jockey engagement tip the scales.

## KEY RISKS

1. First run at 1100m - all career starts at 1000m or shorter (except trials)
2. Soft 5 may deteriorate further with rain forecast - could become Heavy

## FIELD SUMMARY

## MARKET NOTES

- Market favors Bassett Hound ($3.10) despite 1 start for 5th - appears over-bet
- Sound Of Speed drifted from $4.50 to $5.50 - value has emerged
- Twisted Steel ($3.90) and Aberdeen Flyer ($5.00) attract support based on recent trials
- Market percentage: 124.4% (reasonable for provincial)
