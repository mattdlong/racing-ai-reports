## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Haida Gwaii recorded 57.39s winning at Ascot 1000m (Dec 13), fastest recent figure in field.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - small field, likely genuine tempo from the start with Haida Gwaii and Amaroo Star both forward runners.
**Class**: BM72 level suits several; Haida Gwaii rising after dominant wins at lower grades.
**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - Soft 5 conditions key differentiator today.

## WET TRACK FORM - CRITICAL FACTOR

| # | Horse | Soft Record | Heavy | Assessment |
|---|-------|-------------|-------|------------|
| 4 | Haida Gwaii | 1/2 (50%) | 1/1 (100%) | **PROVEN** |
| 3 | Keep Ita Mystery | 1/4 (25%) | 0/1 | ADEQUATE |
| 1 | Sinful Living | 1/4 (25%) | 0/0 | ADEQUATE |
| 5 | Amaroo Star | **0/5 (0%)** | 0/0 | **CONCERN** |
| 6 | Tycoon Harry | **0/4 (0%)** | 0/1 | **CONCERN** |
| 2 | Keep Reading | 2/18 (11%) | 2/3 | HANDLES |
| 7 | Crippalenko | 1/4 (25%) | 0/0 | ADEQUATE |

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Haida Gwaii** is the clear value play in Soft 5 conditions. The 4yo mare has won 6 of 11 starts (55%) including victories on soft and heavy ground. She recorded the fastest 1000m time in this field (57.39s) when winning at Ascot on Dec 13, then backed up with another win on Jan 1. The market favourite **Amaroo Star** ($3.10) has never placed in 5 starts on soft ground - a glaring vulnerability on today's rain-affected track. With William Pike aboard, Amaroo Star will attract support but represents poor value given the wet track query. At $4.20, Haida Gwaii offers +34.4% edge with proven wet track credentials.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (7) in small field - may need to use petrol early
2. Step up to BM72 after beating weaker fields
