## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Silver Eye won last 2 starts (1500m, 1400m Ascot) and peaking at right time. Back-to-back wins on 17/01 and 10/01 show horse in career-best form.

**Wet Track**: Silver Eye's wet form is exceptional - 4 wins from 8 starts on soft/heavy (50% strike rate) vs 15% on good. Current Soft 5 is ideal.

**Class**: Rising from RTG72+ to BM78 but form suggests ready. 57% career place rate demonstrates consistency at higher grades.

**Barrier**: Barrier 3 allows tactical options - can sit handy or stalk. No traffic concerns in 8-runner field.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Silver Eye is the clear value play on wet track credentials. The 50% win rate on soft/heavy vs 15% on good tracks represents a massive upgrade in conditions. Back-to-back wins show form trajectory, and the 82% career place rate (23/28) indicates consistency that translates to smaller fields. Market has Famous Dain favored but his soft track record (4/8 wins, 50%) is no better than Silver Eye at a shorter price. The $3.50 offers genuine overlay.

## KEY RISKS

1. Rising in class from RTG72+ to BM78 - first run at this level
2. Only 1 previous start at 1600m (unplaced) - distance query remains

## MARKET ANALYSIS

- **Market Favorite**: Famous Dain @ $3.20 (implied 31%)
- **Market %**: 124% (balanced book)
- **Expert Support**: Mixed - 4 sources split between #3, #5, #2, #6
