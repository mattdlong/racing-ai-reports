| 2 | Alaskan | 5 | $9 | 9% | 23% | -19% | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Wet Track**: Soft 5 with rain forecast is the critical factor. Lova Session (8pl/12 soft, 1/1 heavy) has clear wet track credentials vs Mangifera (0 soft starts) and Forever Dreaming (1/10 soft).

**Class**: BM72 represents a rise for most. Mangifera stepping up from CL3 wins at provincials - untested at this level and on wet.

**Pace**: Moderate expected with Defending and Forever Dreaming likely to press. Mid-field runners should get a clear run.

**Barrier**: Wide draws (11, 12) disadvantage Show The Way and Mangifera. Low draws favor Defending (1), Ginger And Tonic (2), Forever Dreaming (3).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Lova Session represents standout each-way value at $14. Her 56% career place rate (22/39) identifies her as a strong place specialist (score 4.35). Critical wet track form: 8 places from 12 soft track starts plus a win from her only heavy track start. Second-up after a fair 6th at Ascot 1600m. The $3.40 place odds offer genuine value given her consistency profile and conditions suit.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise to BM72 - previous best at 0MWLY level
2. Wide barrier (6) in 12-horse field - needs luck from midfield

## MARKET RISKS

**Mangifera** (#6 $5.00) - Most talented but ZERO soft track experience is a major red flag on Soft 5 with rain. Wide barrier 12 compounds the issue. PASS on win, watch only.

**Defending** (#1 $3.40) - Poor recent form (4-8-5-x-9-8) doesn't justify favoritism. Has wet track ability (2w/5pl from 11 soft) but no value at odds.

**Forever Dreaming** (#4 $4.00) - Best recent form (1-2-2) but only 1 win from 10 soft starts (10%). Over-bet based on good track form.
