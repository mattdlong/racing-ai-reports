## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Decision Maker's soft track record is exceptional (2 wins, 5 places from 8 soft starts = 88% ITM). Both career wins came on Soft going. The $9.00 odds significantly underrate this horse on today's Soft 5 surface.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. On Patrol and Rally The Troops likely to vie for early lead from wide draws (barriers 8 and 2). Decision Maker settles midfield and can pounce late when the pace setters tire over 1500m.

**Class**: BM64 suits Decision Maker who has been competitive in RTG 66+ grade. Recent 6th at Ascot 1500m was only 0.4L behind winner in slightly stronger company.

**Going**: Critical factor. Soft 5 with rain forecast plays directly to Decision Maker's strengths. On Patrol has 1/8 soft record (13%), Rally The Troops 1/3 (33%), neither handle wet ground as well.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Decision Maker is a proven wet-tracker returning to his preferred surface after struggling on Good ground. The 88% place strike rate on soft tracks is exceptional, earning a Place Specialist Score of 1.56 (Strong Specialist). At $9.00, the market has overlooked this horse's wet track prowess. With William Pike on the favorite On Patrol (barrier 8, poor soft record), the market may be overrating the short-priced runners.

## KEY RISKS

1. Limited Ascot 1500m experience (1 start, 6th) - unproven at C/D
2. Wide barrier (5 of 9) in small field could be disadvantaged if rail runs fast
3. Needs rain to persist - if track dries to Good 4, edge diminishes

## MARKET ANALYSIS

- Market %: 124.5% (standard overround)
- Favorite: On Patrol $3.40 (implied 29%) - short given poor soft record
- Value identified: Decision Maker $9.00 (implied 11%) vs assessed 15%

## GREEN LIGHTS

1. Exceptional soft track record (88% ITM)
2. Both career wins on Soft going
3. Genuine 1500m form (won at 1650m on Soft)

## RED FLAGS

1. Limited Ascot course form
