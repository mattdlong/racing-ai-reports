## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No established speed figures - field of lightly-raced maidens/low-class runners. Keep It Real has most consistent performances (3x2nds).

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Brutal Command and Incontestable likely to press, Keep It Real settles midfield. 1140m sprint favors tactical speed.

**Class**: Provincial CL2 - weak maiden/restricted class. Keep It Real drops from Randwick 2yo racing (soft track form only). Freedman stable strong factor.

**Bias**: Neutral bias expected (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified. Rain forecast may shift conditions.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Keep It Real (#6)** is the clear class runner with 100% place strike rate (3 starts, 3 seconds) and connections to Anthony & Sam Freedman. However, at $2.35 the market has priced in this advantage fully - fair odds closer to $2.86. The horse has only raced on SOFT tracks (3 runs all soft) and today's Good 4 with rain represents an unknown variable.

**Brutal Command (#3)** is a well-bred debutant from Hayes stable with a good trial (2nd at Bendigo 800m). First starters are always risky, but $4.00 offers no margin for the unknowns.

**Harry De Lad (#4)** at $8.50 shows the only marginal edge (+2%) but with low confidence. Recent 2nd at Warrnambool was encouraging but inconsistent prior form.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Keep It Real**: Untested on Good ground - all 3 runs on Soft tracks
2. **Debutants/Lightly Raced**: High uncertainty across field - 7 of 9 runners have 3 or fewer starts
3. **Rain Forecast**: Track may deteriorate - would favor Keep It Real

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

- Market percentage: 128.9% (high margin)
- Favorite implied: 42.5% (Keep It Real)
- Assessed true probability: ~35%
- Value rating: UNDERLAY (-18% edge)

The favorite is well found but overbet. No standout value in the race.
