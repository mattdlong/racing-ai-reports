| 13 | Kingsford | 13 | $12.00 | 3-3-x-2 | 63% | - | PASS |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No clear speed standout. Bergasun and Flashlight showed ability at longer trips but inconsistent figures.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected with El James (bar 1) likely to roll forward. Few genuine on-pace types in a 15-runner field at 1755m suits off-pace runners.

**Class**: BM62 provincial - several recent maiden winners stepping up (Mrs Harris, Lafont, Kingsford, Move The Torana). True class test for these.

**Bias**: Neutral track bias at Geelong (LOW confidence). Good 4 surface with rain expected - monitor for downgrade.

## CONTENDER NOTES

**#3 Flashlight ($5.50 FAV)**: Strong place specialist (2.43 score). 2W/8P from 14 starts (57%). Recent 2nd at Echuca BM56 (1600m) and 1st at Swan Hill BM56 (2400m). Stepping up to BM62 but excellent consistency. Inside barrier helps. Key danger but short price.

**#8 Mrs Harris ($6.50)**: Highest place rate in field at 67% (1W/4P from 6 starts). Won maiden impressively at Stawell by 3L (1600m). Tony & Calvin McEvoy stable. First crack at BM62 - genuine query if good enough but place claims solid.

**#10 Subtle Power ($6.50)**: Another strong placer (58%, 1W/7P from 12). Hayes stable. Recent 3rd at Pakenham BM62 (1600m) - proven at this level. Wide barrier (10) concern in 15-horse field.

**#11 Move The Torana ($7.50)**: Won maiden at Terang (1400m) then 3rd at Werribee BM56 (1629m). Lindsey Smith stable. Stepping up but form franked. Wide draw (11) significant negative.

**#7 Lafont ($7.00)**: Lightly raced (4 starts) - won maiden at Sale then 7th in 0-66. Phillip Stokes. Unknown quantity at this trip/class but upside potential.

## KEY RISKS

1. Market overround 128.7% - no value available at current prices
2. Large field (15 runners) increases variance significantly
3. Rain forecast may alter track condition from Good 4
4. Multiple recent maiden winners untested at BM62 level

## PLACE SPECIALISTS

Strong place specialist scores detected:
- Mrs Harris: 3.31 (STRONG)
- Move The Torana: 3.03 (STRONG)
- Subtle Power: 2.65 (STRONG)
- Flashlight: 2.43 (STRONG)

However, place odds ($2.20-$2.60) insufficient to offset 128% overround.

## RECOMMENDATION

**PASS** - While Flashlight, Mrs Harris and Subtle Power show excellent place consistency, the market overround (128.7%) eliminates any edge. No bet qualifies for Best Bet or EW Value designation. Consider monitoring if odds drift significantly or market overround reduces closer to race time.

If forced to take a view: Flashlight and Mrs Harris offer best place credentials from favorable barriers.
