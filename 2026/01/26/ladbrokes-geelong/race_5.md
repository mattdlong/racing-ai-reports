## SCRATCHINGS

- #2 Thunder Park (Scratched)
- #8 Becauseyou're Mine (Scratched)
- #11 Good Boy Carlo (Scratched)

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figure emerges. Viasain's win at Kyneton (64.70s/1103m) and Arabella Star's Gawler win (65.21s/1107m) are comparable figures at this trip.

**Pace**: MODERATE pace expected. No dominant leaders; Viasain, Surprisatic and Arabella Star all show on-pace racing styles. Mid-field runners should get their chance.

**Class**: Field is competitive at BM66 level. Viasain rising after BM62 win; Arabella Star up from 3YO CL1 win. Both stepping up appropriately.

**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence - rail position not specified. Neutral bias assumed.

## TOP CONTENDERS

### #3 VIASAIN ($3.00) - MARKET FAVOURITE
- **Form**: 6-5-x-1-5 | Career: 3 wins, 5 places from 12 starts (25%/67%)
- **Positives**: Last start winner at Kyneton (1103m), proven at distance (2 wins from 3 starts at 1100m), good record on Good ground (2/8)
- **Concerns**: Wide barrier 8, beaten at Sandown last start (5th of 13), outside draw costs on tight track
- **Assessment**: Score 56.5. Fair odds at $3.03. Market accurate - no edge.

### #9 ARABELLA STAR ($3.10) - MAIN DANGER
- **Form**: x-5-1-4-1-2 | Career: 2 wins, 3 places from 6 starts (33%/83%)
- **Positives**: Lightly raced filly, won impressively at Gawler by 3.3L, excellent place consistency (83%)
- **Concerns**: Failed at Geelong previously (5th, Heavy track), yet to win at this venue, fair odds $3.57
- **Assessment**: Score 45.2. Underlaid at $3.10 - no value.

### #5 THAILESS ($6.50) - PLACE CHANCE
- **Form**: 3-5-3-3-5 | Career: 3 wins, 14 places from 26 starts (12%/65%)
- **Positives**: Strong place specialist score (1.95), consistent performer (54% place rate), barrier 2 advantage
- **Concerns**: Struggles to win (12% strike rate), no wins at this distance (0/6), low ceiling
- **Assessment**: Place specialist profile. EW EV -7.0%. Not enough value at current odds.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

This is a competitive BM66 with no standout value. The two market leaders (Viasain and Arabella Star) both have legitimate claims but the market has priced them accurately. Viasain has the fitness edge (30 days since last run vs barrier trial only) and proven at the trip, but wide barrier 8 is a concern at Geelong.

Thailess offers place appeal with excellent consistency (54% place rate) and inside barrier, but limited win upside at 12% career strike rate doesn't justify EW at $6.50.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barriers for Viasain (8) and Surprisatic (10) on tight Geelong track
2. Arabella Star untested on Good ground at Geelong (previous start there was Heavy)
