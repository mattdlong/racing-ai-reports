# Ladbrokes Geelong R2 | 1440m Maiden Plate
Sun 26 Jan | 1:45pm | 10r | Good 4

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #5 TROOPER @ $9.00 - 1.0u E/W**

Place specialist qualifies via Path B (specialist score 1.67, odds >= $8)

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 10 | Veyepee | 3.50 | 30.7 | 22% | -23% | WATCH | - |
| 8 | Hallowed Halls | 3.60 | 28.0 | 20% | -28% | PASS | - |
| 6 | Cuttin' Class | 4.20 | 37.0 | 18% | -24% | WATCH | - |
| 7 | Fire Type | 5.50 | 32.0 | 14% | -23% | WATCH | - |
| 4 | Terrortorian | 6.00 | 30.0 | 12% | -28% | PASS | - |
| 5 | Trooper | 9.00 | 37.4 | 10% | -10% | VALUE | 1.0 |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No reliable speed figures available - maiden field with limited race history. Veyepee won a jump out impressively, Cuttin' Class has the best race form (2nd on debut).

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No confirmed leaders; likely tactical early with Fire Type (barrier 3) and Hallowed Halls (barrier 5) likely to press. Trooper (barrier 13) will need luck from wide.

**Class**: Weak provincial maiden ($850 prizemoney). All runners either lightly-raced or exposed maidens. Veyepee (Freedman debut), Hallowed Halls (Waller), and Cuttin' Class (Maher) have stable support but limited evidence.

**Bias**: Neutral bias expected (LOW confidence). No significant barrier or style bias detected at Geelong today.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Trooper** qualifies as Each-Way Value via Path B (Place Specialist). At 5 starts with 2 placings (40% place rate), the Hawkes-trained gelding significantly outperforms his expected place rate (24%) for a horse of his win probability. He has course experience at Geelong (2 starts: 3rd and 4th) and handles the Good surface (1 place from 3 starts). The $9.00 odds provide sufficient margin for EW value despite the wide barrier (13). Senior jockey Teo Nugent knows the horse and should settle midfield with cover before finishing strongly.

The market leaders are risky: Veyepee is a debut runner with no race experience (trial form only), and Hallowed Halls was disappointing on debut (9th of 12 at Pakenham). Cuttin' Class has the best form but was beaten 7 lengths on debut and the mid-barriers at $4.20 don't offer sufficient value.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (13) in 10-horse field - needs early luck to slot in
2. Rain forecast could deteriorate track - no heavy track form
3. Stable debutants (Veyepee, Hallowed Halls) could improve significantly on race experience
