Sun 26 Jan | 10:00am | 9r | Soft 5 | Rain

Place specialist with 60% career place rate (6/10) on strong upward trajectory from country wins.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited recent timing data available; Commanding Artist (94.59s/1550m) and Climb The Ladder (95.66s/1600m) the most reliable speed figures.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Lancelot Du Lac likely to settle midfield from barrier 2. No confirmed leaders; race should unfold evenly with closers getting their chance.

**Class**: Lancelot Du Lac drops from 3YO BM72 to BM64 - significant class drop but only 2 career starts. Climb The Ladder (BM72), Fiftyfivechevy (BM72), and Commanding Artist (BM64) are at their mark. Rotho Bro rising sharply from country CL2 wins.

**Bias**: Neutral bias on Soft 5 track. No significant style or barrier advantage detected (LOW confidence).

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#4 LANCELOT DU LAC ($2.60)** - Market elect at short odds but significant query marks. Only 2 career starts (1-1-0), won Kensington maiden by 2.44L but 4th in 3YO BM72 at Randwick behind quality horses. NO wet track experience (0 soft/heavy starts). Waterhouse/Bott stable strong but price is skinny given unknowns. First time at 1600m. FAIR value at best.

**#2 CLIMB THE LADDER ($3.10)** - Waller-trained 4yo with 46% place rate (6/13). Solid 2nd at Kensington (1800m, Soft) last start though beaten 3.77L. Handles wet going (1 place from 2 soft starts). Nash Rawiller aboard. Consistent but rarely wins (8% strike rate). UNDERLAY at current odds.

**#7 ROTHO BRO ($26.00)** - Country-class improver stepping up sharply. Won back-to-back at Orange (CL1 & CL2, 1400m) in Dec/Jan. Career: 3-6-0 from 10 starts = 90% place rate in placings (60% actual). Handles soft (1 win, 2 places from 3 soft starts). First time at 1600m but won up to 1450m. Big class rise but PLACE SPECIALIST SCORE of 6.25 makes EW attractive at odds.

**#1 COMMANDING ARTIST ($8.00)** - Ryan/Alexiou gelding resuming strongly with 2nd at Canterbury (1550m, Soft, BM64) - beaten just 0.96L. Won at Hawkesbury (1300m) and Canterbury (1100m) two runs prior. Wet track: 1-2-0 from 4 soft starts. Concern: wide barrier (9) and stepping up to 1600m first time. Jay Ford rides.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**ROTHO BRO** qualifies as Each-Way Value via Path B (Place Specialist). His 60% career place rate (including places in 3 of last 4 starts) against an expected 9.6% suggests genuine place aptitude regardless of win chances. At $26/$5.00 place, the EW EV calculates at +19.4% with the place component alone at +34.9%. The horse has won his last two starts and shown consistent improvement through the grades. The class rise is significant but the value compensates. Dylan Gibbons is a capable lightweight claim booking.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Class rise**: Rotho Bro stepping from country CL2 to metro BM64 - 2-3 class jumps
2. **Distance query**: First time at 1600m, previous wins at 1400m
3. **Favorite query**: Lancelot Du Lac has no wet track data, could fail on Soft 5

## MARKET NOTES

- Lancelot Du Lac dominant favorite at $2.60 (38% implied) despite wet track query
- Climb The Ladder solid second elect but short at $3.10
- Field lacks clear standout value on WIN market
- EW value emerges through place specialist path at double-figure odds
