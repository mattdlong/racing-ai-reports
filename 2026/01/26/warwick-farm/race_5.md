# Warwick Farm R5 | 1400m BM72
Sun 26 Jan | 10:00am | 9r | Soft 5

## ACTION

**NO BET - Favorite over-bet; no value identified in field**

Market dominated by short-priced Mamushka ($2.20) who has questionable wet track form. No selection qualifies for Best Bet (insufficient edge) or Each-Way Value (negative EW EV across all contenders).

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 2 | Mamushka | 2.20 | 47.2 | 38% | -16% | VALUE | - |
| 7 | Siebert | 6.50 | 38.4 | 14% | -9% | WATCH | - |
| 8 | Oui Flourish | 6.50 | 36.0 | 13% | -16% | WATCH | - |
| 1 | Tequila Baby | 6.00 | 34.0 | 12% | -28% | WATCH | - |
| 5 | Shanoni | 9.00 | 32.0 | 10% | -10% | WATCH | - |
| 6 | Ishikari | 19.00 | 28.0 | 5% | -5% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited recent 1400m data; Mamushka clocked 76.11s for 1300m at Randwick (26/12) - extrapolates to ~82s for 1400m on good track.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Tequila Baby likely to press forward with Mamushka settling midfield. No confirmed leaders creates uncertainty.

**Class**: BM72 provincial metro standard. Mamushka rising from maiden win; Siebert and Oui Flourish both stepping up after recent wins at lower levels.

**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence. Soft 5 conditions favor proven wet-trackers - notably Titanium Miss (2 wins from 11 soft/heavy) and Ishikari (1/3 soft, 1/1 heavy).

## CONTENDER NOTES

**#2 MAMUSHKA ($2.20)** - Market leader with impressive form (3 wins from 8, 75% place rate). Won well at Randwick 1300m last start. CONCERNS: 0/3 on soft tracks with only 1 placing; stepping up to 1400m untested; price too short given wet track query. Fair odds ~$2.63.

**#7 SIEBERT ($6.50)** - Progressive 3yo filly for Waterhouse/Bott. 2 wins from 4 starts, 75% place rate (Strong Place Specialist score 2.2). Second last start Beaumont 1350m soft. CONCERNS: 7th only run at Warwick Farm (heavy track); stepping up in class. Best value in the race if holds form.

**#8 OUI FLOURISH ($6.50)** - Lightly raced 3yo with just 1 career start (impressive 1300m maiden win at Kembla Soft 5). Unknown quantity stepping into midweek metro BM72 company. CONCERNS: Minimal exposure; 22 days between runs; untested at the level.

**#4 TITANIUM MISS ($11.00)** - WET TRACK SPECIALIST: 2 wins, 6 places from 11 starts on soft/heavy (18% win, 73% place). Inside barrier a plus. CONCERNS: Only 9% career win rate; 0/4 at 1400m; form has been modest.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft 5 conditions** - Mamushka untested, several roughies improve on wet
2. **Class rise** - Multiple runners stepping up from lower grades
3. **Low expert consensus** - Only 1 source checked, limited confidence in tips

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market percentage: 126% (standard overround)
Favorite implied: 45.5% vs assessed 38% = **16% overbet**
Best market value: Titanium Miss ($11) has wet track credentials but poor win strike rate
