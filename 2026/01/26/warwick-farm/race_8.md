# Warwick Farm R8 | 1000m BM72
Sun 26 Jan | 10:00am | 11r | Soft 5

## ACTION

**STRONG_VALUE: #3 GENEROUS HARRY @ $6.50 - 1.5u EW**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 3 | Generous Harry | 6.50 | 62 | 18% | +17% | STRONG_VALUE | 1.5% |
| 2 | Shalaa Gold | 3.40 | 55 | 25% | -15% | WATCH | - |
| 11 | Nazwah | 3.20 | 48 | 20% | -36% | WATCH | - |
| 4 | Straand Beauty | 4.00 | 45 | 15% | -40% | WATCH | - |
| 5 | Action King | 13.00 | 38 | 8% | +4% | PASS | - |
| 7 | Spartus | 51.00 | 32 | 4% | +104% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Generous Harry produced 57.20s at Gosford (1000m Good) last start, winning by 0.15L - competitive figure for this grade.

**Pace**: CONTESTED - multiple early speed types (Shalaa Gold, Straand Beauty, Action King) likely to press early, setting up for on-pace runners with tactical speed.

**Class**: Rising from BM64 to BM72 after back-to-back wins. Fresh form excellent: 1-1-1-2 in last 4 completed starts. Nazwah resuming from 183-day break into a strong BM72 field is a query.

**Bias**: Neutral track bias detected (LOW confidence). Soft 5 conditions suit several runners.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Generous Harry (3) presents genuine each-way value at $6.50. The Ron Quinton-trained 5yo is in career-best form with 3 wins from last 4 starts, stepping up to BM72 off dominant provincial wins. Career place rate of 60% (6/10) gives strong place probability of 49.2%. EW EV of +16.9% qualifies via Path A (Value Overlay). The inside barrier (6) suits in the likely contested pace scenario. While Nazwah ($3.20) has class, the long layoff (183 days) and first run at 1000m are concerns at skinny odds.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise (BM64 to BM72) - first test at this level
2. Wide field (11 runners) with contested pace may produce rough race

## MARKET ANALYSIS

- Market favorite Nazwah ($3.20) represents -36% edge - skinny after long layoff
- Shalaa Gold ($3.40) is the most consistent (91% place rate) but resuming 130 days
- Generous Harry ($6.50) offers only genuine value in market with +17% edge

## EACH-WAY VALUE ASSESSMENT

| Horse | Place Prob | EW EV | Specialist | Qualifies |
|-------|------------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Generous Harry | 49.2% | +16.9% | 1.39 (YES) | PATH A |
| Shalaa Gold | 69.1% | -8.2% | 1.52 (YES) | NO |
| Straand Beauty | 42.2% | -22% | N/A | NO |

**Path A Criteria Met**: Odds $6.50 >= $6, EW EV +16.9% >= +5%, Place Prob 49% >= 30%
