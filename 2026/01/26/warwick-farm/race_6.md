## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Future History has best recent figures - 3 wins from last 4 including January Cup (2000m) and Christmas Cup (2400m). Peak form.

**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected. No confirmed leaders; Future History and Saint George both versatile. Suits on-pace runners.

**Class**: Future History proven at this level with quality staying wins. Saint George stepping up in trip (untested beyond 2025m). Newfoundland has Adelaide Cup placing at 3200m.

**Bias**: No significant bias detected (LOW confidence). Soft 5 suits Future History (5/15 soft track) and Newfoundland (2/3 soft track).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Future History** ($3.20) is the clear standout on current form. Three wins from last four starts against quality opposition (Christmas Cup, January Cup, Bagot Hcp) demonstrates he's racing at career peak. The 8-day backup is optimal for this horse who thrives on racing. Proven soft track performer (33% win rate on soft vs 22% overall). Only query is first time at Warwick Farm, but distance form is strong. At $3.20, assessed at 34% win probability giving +8.8% edge - marginal but playable given form quality.

**Newfoundland** ($6.50) represents Each-Way value via Path A. Strong place specialist score (1.806) with 65% career place rate. Course and distance winner (1/1 at WF, 2/4 at 2400m). Excellent soft track record (2/3 wins on soft). Light weight (54kg) suits over this trip. Adelaide Cup runner-up shows staying credentials.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Future History**: First run at Warwick Farm - no course form to assess track suitability
2. **Saint George**: Market favorite at $2.30 has poor soft track form (0/3) - significant vulnerability
