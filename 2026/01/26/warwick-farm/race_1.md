## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Bryant best figure holder; won trial at Randwick (1050m) 11 days ago in 64.09s, clear of maidens.
**Pace**: MODERATE - no confirmed leaders; Bryant likely to settle on-pace from barrier 6.
**Class**: Low-grade CL1; Bryant only horse with recent winning form (trial) at city level.
**Bias**: Soft 5 track; Bryant 0/2 soft but placed; Cassie's Angel only winner on heavy.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Bryant is a class above this field - returning from 214-day break but showed sharp form winning a trial at Randwick just 11 days ago. The Ron Quinton-trained gelding has Joshua Parr aboard and draws barrier 6 which should allow a forward position. However, at $1.75 (implied 57%), the market has him accurately priced when we assess true probability around 52%. The 9% underlay offers no value for punters despite the horse being the most likely winner.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Long spell** - 214 days since racing (trial mitigates somewhat)
2. **Soft track query** - 0/2 on soft, only place came in heavy conditions
3. **Price compression** - no overlay available at current odds

## FIELD ANALYSIS

| # | Horse | Bar | J/T | Form | Going | Comment |
|---|-------|-----|-----|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Bryant | 6 | Parr/Quinton | x4294x | 0-0-1 soft | Class edge, trial winner, too short |
| 2 | Carafe | 7 | Jones/Wagstaff | 47269x | 0-0-0 soft | Exposed maiden, no hope |
| 3 | Cassie's Angel | 1 | Llewellyn/Hopkins | 2 | 0-0-1 hvy | One start, 2nd Tuncurry (hvy), unknown |
| 4 | Epic | 2 | Schiller/Hawkes | 7 | 0-0-0 soft | Hawkes 3yo, one start (7th), needs more |
| 5 | Gus The Great | 8 | Schofield/Pride | 4x | 0-0-0 soft | Pride runner, wide draw, 158 days off |
| 6 | Maidoff | 5 | Fitzgerald/Conners | 3x | 0-0-1 good | Placed 2 runs back, 113 days off |
| 7 | Northy Lad | 4 | Berry/Cummings | - | debut | Trialled only, Berry booking notable |
| 8 | Zousari | 3 | Collett/Coyle | 83x26 | 0-0-1 soft | Placed form, quick back-up (2 days) |

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

- **Market %**: 124% (overround typical for CL1)
- **Favourite**: Bryant $1.75 (57% implied)
- **Value scan**: No overlays detected in field
- **Expert consensus**: Split tips across Bryant, Gus The Great, Maidoff, Epic (25% each)

## VERDICT

PASS race - dominant favourite priced too short, roughies lack form credentials to oppose. Wait for better opportunities later in card.
