# Warwick Farm R7 | 1400m BM72
Sun 26 Jan | 10:00am | 11r | Soft 5

## ACTION

**VALUE: #2 DUVANA @ $6.00 - 1.0u EW**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 4 | Anthracite | $3.00 | 42.2 | 28% | -16% | WATCH | - |
| 2 | Duvana | $6.00 | 48.1 | 18% | +8% | VALUE | 1.0% |
| 5 | Hopper | $4.80 | 44.0 | 20% | -4% | WATCH | - |
| 3 | Missile Seeker | $8.00 | 40.5 | 12% | -4% | WATCH | - |
| 9 | Il Passero | $9.00 | 38.0 | 11% | -1% | WATCH | - |
| 1 | Saint Emilion | $14.00 | 32.0 | 7% | -2% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Anthracite has best raw ability (3 wins from 4 starts) but 134 days off and two trial failures raise concerns.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected with Duvana, Hydrometer, and Il Passero pressing forward; suits on-pace types.
**Class**: Anthracite dropping from provincial wins but first Sydney start; Duvana rising from BM64 win with soft form.
**Bias**: Soft 5 track with rain - Duvana has proven soft track form (1 win, 2 places from 6 soft starts).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Duvana offers the best value at $6.00 with genuine each-way appeal. Won BM64 at Beaumont on soft (13/12), then placed at BM78 level (6th of 11, only 0.7L off). Has proven wet track credentials (1/1/2 from 6 soft, 1/1/1 from 3 heavy) while favorite Anthracite has failed both recent barrier trials and faces first-up Sydney assignment after 134 days off. The $6.00 provides +8% edge to fair odds of $5.56. With 46% place probability and EW EV of +5.7%, this qualifies via Path A as each-way value.

## KEY RISKS

1. Anthracite has superior ability if anywhere near peak - three dominant provincial wins
2. Duvana's BM78 form was at Randwick on Good - this is BM72 but at Warwick Farm on Soft
