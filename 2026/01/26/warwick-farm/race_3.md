## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Let's Go Barbie has best recent figures (72) from 2nd at Kensington last start.
**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected - Feazabeel and Let's Go Barbie likely on pace.
**Class**: CL1 maiden/class race, no standout class rise or drop.
**Bias**: No significant bias detected (neutral rail, wet track).

## RUNNER NOTES

**#7 LET'S GO BARBIE** ($2.40) - Chris Waller 4yo mare with 75% place rate (3/4). Narrow 2nd last start at Kensington (0.1L margin). Jason Collett aboard. Clear top pick but market right - no edge at $2.40. Fair odds ~$2.65.

**#1 INDIGO STAR** ($3.90) - Waller stablemate with consistent minor placings (45% place rate over 11 starts). Never won but rarely far away. Nash Rawiller up. Place EV +14% but win EV -14%. Watch for place market value.

**#5 FEAZABEEL** ($5.50) - Resuming after 171 days off. 2nd on heavy at 1400m at Kembla (Aug). Has ability but first-up query after long break. Needs fitness.

**#4 DELICIOUS DEREK** ($6.50) - Tommy Berry on Waller 3yo. 2nd last start Canterbury over 1250m. Stepping up to 1400m suits. Soft track form 0/3-1. Needs luck from barrier 6.

## KEY RISKS

1. Short-priced favorite dominates - no value in field
2. Wet track (Soft 5 + Rain) creates unpredictability
3. Several lightly-raced runners with unknown wet ability

## MARKET NOTES

- Market % 124.6% (overround)
- Favorite implied probability 41.7%
- Expert tips split: #1, #4, #5, #7 all mentioned (1 source)
