# Warwick Farm R2 | 1100m CL1
Sun 26 Jan | 10:00am | 9r | Soft 5

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Insufficient edge on top contenders. Market accurately priced.

Both favourites offer marginal value at best. Farfetched (#2) shows slight +2% edge but insufficient for confident stake. First-up fillies race with limited formlines makes this a WATCH race.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 2 | Farfetched | $3.40 | 48.9 | 30% | +2.0% | VALUE | - |
| 1 | Fairway To Heaven | $3.10 | 45.5 | 28% | -0.8% | VALUE | - |
| 9 | Rave About It | $6.00 | 42.0 | 17% | +2.0% | WATCH | - |
| 8 | Oz Princess | $8.50 | 38.0 | 12% | +2.0% | WATCH | - |
| 10 | Sphere | $7.50 | 36.0 | 13% | -2.5% | WATCH | - |
| 6 | Mediterra | $20.00 | 32.0 | 5% | +0.0% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Farfetched (#2) recorded 58.01s for 1000m last start - best time in field. Fairway To Heaven showed 64.09s for 1050m at Randwick (2nd).

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Three on-pace types (Fairway To Heaven, Mediterra, Rave About It) but none dominant early speed. Should suit stalkers.

**Class**: CL1 with $5,500 prize. Weak formlines - most runners have limited race experience. Farfetched and Fairway To Heaven both coming off placings.

**Bias**: Neutral bias expected. Soft 5 track suits those with wet form - Fairway To Heaven (1:0-0-1 soft), Farfetched (1:0-0-1 soft) both proven.

## FIELD ASSESSMENT

| # | Horse | Bar | Trainer | Form | Going | Comment |
|---|-------|-----|---------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Fairway To Heaven | 1 | M Freedman | 3x | 1:0-0-1 | Best barrier, Berry up, 193d spell concern |
| 2 | Farfetched | 8 | Waterhouse/Bott | 2 | 1:0-0-1 | Top stable, narrow 2nd LT, wide draw |
| 3 | Firepop | 10 | Ryan/Alexiou | 65x27 | 4:0-0-1 | Widest draw, inconsistent, pass |
| 5 | Mayleigh | 9 | J Sargent | - | 0:0-0-0 | Debut, trials OK, watch brief |
| 6 | Mediterra | 2 | C Maher | 5x452 | 1:0-0-0 | Poor wet form (0/1), good draw |
| 7 | Olivia Twist | 6 | B Widdup | 7x | 0:0-0-0 | 141d spell, no wet form, unknown |
| 8 | Oz Princess | 5 | Waterhouse/Bott | - | 0:0-0-0 | Debut, Tim Clark up, respect |
| 9 | Rave About It | 4 | J Pride | - | 0:0-0-0 | Two 2nds from trials, good draw |
| 10 | Sphere | 3 | C Waller | 6x3 | 2:0-0-1 | Waller filly, soft track form |

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Farfetched** (#2) rates top on exposed form after a close 2nd at Kensington (1000m, Soft). The Waterhouse/Bott filly by I Am Invincible has stable form indicators and Bayliss retains the ride. However, barrier 8 in a 9-horse field is a negative, and the $3.40 offers only marginal +2% edge - insufficient for a confident WIN bet.

**Fairway To Heaven** (#1) draws perfectly in barrier 1 with Tommy Berry aboard. The Michael Freedman filly has trialled well and showed ability when 2nd at Randwick (1050m). The 193-day spell is the key concern - first-up without a public trial is a red flag despite barrier trials suggesting fitness.

This is a race where the market has accurately priced the two favourites. Neither offers sufficient edge for a recommended bet.

## KEY RISKS

1. Both favourites resuming - first-up failure rate in fillies races is elevated
2. Soft 5 track may deteriorate further - limited wet track data on most runners
3. Wide barriers for Firepop (#3) and Mayleigh (#5) are significant negatives at 1100m

## MARKET WATCH

- If Farfetched drifts to $4.00+, reassess as potential VALUE play
- Monitor late betting on Oz Princess - Waterhouse/Bott debutant with Clark
