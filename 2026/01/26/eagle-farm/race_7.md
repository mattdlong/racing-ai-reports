# Eagle Farm R7 | 1400m BM65
Mon 26 Jan | 10:00am | 14r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Heavy favourite First Empire is unders at $1.65. True odds closer to $2.20-$2.50 based on form profile.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Fair | Edge | Tier | Note |
|---|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| 8 | First Empire | 1.65 | 40% | 2.50 | -34% | WATCH | Short |
| 2 | Dark Arts | 4.50 | 12% | 8.33 | -46% | PASS | No value |
| 12 | Diva Las Vegas | 7.00 | 10% | 10.0 | -30% | PASS | Untested wet |
| 11 | Retainer | 11.00 | 8% | 12.5 | -12% | WATCH | Soft tracker |
| 13 | Poutchek | 10.00 | 7% | 14.3 | -30% | PASS | Struggles BM65 |
| 3 | Vos Savant | - | 8% | 12.5 | - | PASS | No jockey |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: First Empire has the best recent form (4th BM70, 2nd BM70) but stepping to 1400m for first time - a query. Dark Arts 6th in CL1-SW most recent, patchy form pattern.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No dominant leaders in field. First Empire likely to settle midfield, Retainer and Vos Savant can stalk. Wide draws (5, 7, 13, 14) disadvantaged on wet track.

**Class**: BM65 is modest grade. First Empire dropping from BM70 is the key class edge. Vos Savant 2nd in BM70 last start but NO JOCKEY listed - scratching risk.

**Conditions**: Soft 5 with rain is critical factor. First Empire has NO recorded runs on soft/heavy in the data. Dark Arts 1-1-1 on heavy (won maiden), handles wet. Retainer 2-6-2 on soft - genuine wet tracker.

## FAVOURITE ASSESSMENT: FIRST EMPIRE (#8)

**Positives**:
- Kelly Schweida stable in good form
- Michael Rodd booking (top jockey)
- Dropping in class from BM70
- Barrier 1 ideal in wet conditions
- 80% place strike rate (4 from 5)
- Won maiden by 3.88L impressively

**Negatives**:
- $1.65 is too short for true probability (~40%)
- First run at 1400m (untested distance)
- NO soft/heavy track form recorded
- Only 5 career starts - limited sample
- Coming off 29-day break
- 3yo taking on older horses

**Verdict**: Logical favourite but priced as 60% chance when closer to 40%. The $1.65 offers -26% edge. Need $2.20+ for value.

## MARKET MISPRICING

The market has overcorrected on First Empire. At $1.65 implied probability is 60.6%, but:
- Untested at 1400m (adds 10-15% uncertainty)
- No wet track data (Soft 5 is genuine wet)
- Lightly raced 3yo (small sample size)

Fair odds: $2.20-$2.50 (40-45% true probability)

## EACH-WAY WATCH

**Retainer (#11)** @ $11.00 / $2.63 place
- 3rd last start BM62 (0.15L margin)
- 2-6-2 from 8 starts on soft - loves it
- Stuart Kendrick consistent trainer
- Barrier 10 is concern but can settle back
- Place prob: ~21% (fair place odds ~$4.80)
- Current place odds $2.63 = slight underlay

**Dark Arts (#2)** @ $4.50 / $1.62 place
- Tony Gollan stable (top 5 QLD trainer)
- 1-1-1 heavy track record
- But 6th most recent, inconsistent
- Only 2 days since last run - fatigue query

## KEY RISKS

1. **First Empire fails at 1400m** - Has only run 1350m max, this is a step up
2. **Wet track form unknown for favourite** - Soft 5 could find him out
3. **Vos Savant scratching** - No jockey listed, likely to be scratched

## RECOMMENDED STRATEGY

**PASS** on this race. The favourite is too short and alternatives lack value.

If forced to bet:
- LAY First Empire at $1.65 (value is against)
- Small saver on Retainer E/W if drifts to $13+
