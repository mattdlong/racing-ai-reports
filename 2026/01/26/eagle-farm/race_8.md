## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Hot Majesty has the best recent form but unproven at 1840m; Cigar Man showing progressive figures over ground.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no dominant leader, Hot Majesty and Sexy Time likely to settle midfield.
**Class**: BM66 field with most runners coming from CL1/Maidens; step up required for recent maiden winners.
**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain - no strong track bias data available (LOW confidence).

## CONTENDER ASSESSMENT

### #1 Hot Majesty ($2.30) - WATCH
**Positives**: Tony Gollan/Ben Thompson combination; only soft track winner in field (1:2 record); 3rd last start at this track 1600m in CL1; distance win at 1800m.
**Negatives**: Market price of $2.30 implies 43% win probability - assessed at ~29% making this a significant UNDERLAY (-33% edge). Wide barrier (8) in large field on soft track. Only 1 win from 14 starts (7% strike rate).
**Verdict**: Clear class leader but prohibitively short. Fair odds ~$3.45.

### #5 Sexy Time ($4.00) - WATCH
**Positives**: Impressive 3.5L maiden win at 1800m on Soft track (1/1/26); Tony Gollan trained; 33% career win rate (1/3); proven at the distance.
**Negatives**: Only 3 career starts - unproven at BM66 level; wide barrier (14); $4.00 implies 25% probability, assessed at ~15% making this an UNDERLAY (-40% edge). Major class rise from maiden grade.
**Verdict**: Progressive type but stepping up sharply in grade. Too short. Fair odds ~$6.67.

### #4 Cigar Man ($7.50) - WATCH
**Positives**: Strong place consistency (43%); progressive form figures over middle distances; 2nd last start at 1975m Ipswich on Soft; first Eagle Farm start fresh to the track.
**Negatives**: No course or distance experience; wide barrier (11); $7.50 only marginally below fair odds ($8.33); still needs to prove at metro level.
**Verdict**: Closest to value but not compelling. Fair odds ~$8.33. Place specialist score 2.26 but EW shows no value (-14% EV).

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft 5 with rain**: Track may deteriorate further; limited wet form data for most contenders
2. **Wide barriers**: Top 3 market fancies all drawn wide (8, 11, 14) in 15-horse field
3. **Class unknowns**: Several recent maiden winners stepping up significantly

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market percentage: 152% (overbroke)
Favorite implied probability: 43% (Hot Majesty)
Assessed probability: 29%
Edge on favorite: -33% (significant underlay)

No overlay opportunities identified in top 6 contenders. Market has correctly identified the main contenders but prices are compressed, offering no value.
