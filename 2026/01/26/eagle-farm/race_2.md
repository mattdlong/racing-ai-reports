## EDGE TABLE

| 9 | Peregrina Pearl | 10 | $9.50 | 10% | +14% | 31% | WATCH |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited public form data - most runners debuting or lightly raced. Over Spray won trial impressively but untested at 1000m.

**Pace**: CONTESTED - Multiple trial winners will push forward creating genuine tempo, suits runners with tactical speed.

**Class**: Maiden field with several trial winners stepping up. No proven class edge.

**Bias**: Track bias LOW confidence - Soft 5 with rain, inside barriers historically favored on wet Eagle Farm tracks.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Hansaglory** qualifies via Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist). Outstanding trial form with 2nd at Doomben (0.35L margin), 3rd (2.43L), 4th (beaten 0.01L), and 2nd (0.11L). Consistent place profile suggests strong each-way prospect. Barrier 1 is a significant advantage on the Soft 5 with rain, allowing jockey Daniel Moor to save ground throughout. At $9.50, getting +14% edge on assessed 12% win probability with 35% place probability represents genuine each-way value.

The favorite **Over Spray** ($3.00) won a 5-horse trial by 0.16L over 840m but is stepping up in trip and facing a stronger field. At odds implying 33% win probability, we assess closer to 28% - an underlay. Worth respecting but not backing.

## KEY RISKS

1. Debut on race day - trial form doesn't always translate
2. Soft 5 with rain could deteriorate further, adding unpredictability
3. Wide field (14 runners) increases lottery factor for maidens
