## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No reliable speed figures - weak maiden form throughout field. Tacitly's Randwick/Ballina form is clearly best.

**Pace**: SLOW expected - no natural leader. Tacitly from barrier 1 can dictate or box seat. Enjector needs cover mid-field.

**Class**: Tacitly only horse with metro Sydney form (4th Randwick 1400m). Rest are provincial/country maidens.

**Bias**: Track bias confidence LOW. Soft 5 with rain - rail may deteriorate. Inside barriers traditionally assist.

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

**Tacitly ($1.55)**: The obvious horse on form but SHORT. Sydney maiden form (4th Randwick, 2nd Ballina) is 5+ lengths superior to this field. However:
- Only 2 starts on soft, both unplaced (trial/barrier trial)
- First run at Eagle Farm
- $1.55 implies 64.5% chance but assessed at ~50% = -22.5% edge

**Enjector ($3.10)**: Progressive 3yo from Michael Freedman. Placed at Gold Coast soft but hasn't shown turn of foot to match Tacitly. Massive underlay at current price.

**Concador ($12)**: 10-start maiden. Placed twice but never threatened in better grade. Fair price, no value.

**Artistic Touch ($20)**: Only horse showing mathematical value (+20% edge) but 16-start maiden with 0 wins is the definition of exposed. The edge exists because the market is right to discount her winning chance.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

No bet recommended. This is a classic "short favorite with risk" scenario:

1. Tacitly is clearly the best horse on ratings but $1.55 requires a ~65% strike rate to break even
2. Her wet track form is untested (0/2 soft, both trials)
3. The field lacks a genuine danger that offers value - Enjector is worse value than the favorite
4. Artistic Touch shows edge but is a chronic non-winner (0/16)

The correct play is PASS - the favorite has too much risk at the price, and no other runner offers genuine each-way value.

## KEY RISKS

1. Tacitly's soft track form unknown - could handle it or flounder
2. Small field (9r) reduces place value opportunities
3. Rain forecast may further deteriorate track
