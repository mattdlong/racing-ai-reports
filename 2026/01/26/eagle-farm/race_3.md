## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No race times available for meaningful speed figures - all debut/trial form only.
**Pace**: CONTESTED expected - multiple early speed types from wide gates will push forward.
**Class**: Standard metro maiden, first starters dominate the market.
**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain, neutral bias expected (LOW confidence).

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

The market has installed **Crypto Miss** ($2.90) as clear favorite based on:
- Most experienced runner (5 starts, 3 placings)
- Consistent form: 2nd twice at Eagle Farm 1000m
- Proven on Soft tracks (2 placings from 3 soft starts)

However, $2.90 represents implied probability of 34.5% in a 15-horse maiden where:
- 8 runners are unraced/debut
- Tony Gollan has 4 runners (market can't accurately price all)
- Wide barriers for key chances (10, 11, 12)

## CONTENDER NOTES

**#9 CRYPTO MISS** - Best credentials but short odds
- 5 starts: 0-3-0, 60% place rate
- 2 seconds at Eagle Farm 1000m
- Barrier 10 concern in big field
- $2.90 = NO VALUE (fair odds ~$4.00)

**#10 MERCATELLO** - Gollan first-starter, dominant trial
- Won Doomben trial by 2.46L (59.84s)
- Good barrier (5), fits pace
- Unknown quantity = high variance
- $3.60 = risky at odds

**#5 YARANGA** - Trial winner, good gate
- Won Doomben 1000m trial (60.53s)
- Barrier 4, should settle handy
- No race experience
- $5.50 = insufficient margin for risk

## KEY RISKS

1. Large maiden field (15r) creates high variance
2. 8 unraced runners = unpredictable
3. Soft track with rain = slippery, anything can happen
4. Wide barriers for main fancies (9, 10, 11 all drawn wide)

## RECOMMENDATION

**PASS** - No actionable edge identified. This is a watching brief race.

If forced to select for place exotics only:
- **#9 Crypto Miss** - best credentials, likely top 3
- **#10 Mercatello** - Gollan firepower, good trial
- **#5 Yaranga** - gate advantage, solid trial
