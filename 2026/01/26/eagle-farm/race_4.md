## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Nails Murphy shows best recent figures with back-to-back wins at 1600m; last-start win at Sunshine Coast in 95.57s solid for BM85 grade.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected with no dominant leader. Nails Murphy (bar 1) and Mootessa (bar 2) likely to settle forward; Naval Seal and More Trouble midfield.

**Class**: Nails Murphy dropping from BM85 (last 2 wins) to BM78 - clear class advantage. I'm Heroic rises from BM68 - significant class jump. Sir Beveridge rises sharply from provincial CL4.

**Bias**: Soft 5 track with rain. Nails Murphy has 1/8 on soft (12.5%); I'm Heroic is 2/9 on soft (22%) with 2/4 on heavy - wet track improver. Spanish Fox poor on soft (0/5).

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Nails Murphy is the clear class horse - back-to-back wins at BM85 level before dropping to BM78 with barrier 1 and Ciaron Maher training. Career record of 6 wins and 18 places from 27 starts shows consistency. However, $2.30 represents only fair odds - implied probability 43% vs assessed 38%. The edge is marginally negative.

The lack of positive edge across the field makes this a race to watch rather than bet. I'm Heroic (wet tracker) and More Trouble (strong place specialist at 1.79x) warrant monitoring if drifting to $10+.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft track unknown for favorite** - Nails Murphy's soft track record (1/8) is below his good track form (3/14)
2. **Class rise danger** - I'm Heroic and Sir Beveridge both rising sharply in class; could outperform low expectations if track deteriorates further

| 9 | Sir Beveridge | 5 | $23.00 | 4x513 | 1/4 | 0/0 | 25% | PASS |

## GREEN LIGHTS

- **Nails Murphy**: Dropping class, inside barrier, Maher stable, consistent placer (67%)
- **I'm Heroic**: Wet track improver (50% win rate on heavy), blinkers on last 2 starts

## RED FLAGS

- **Spanish Fox**: 0/5 on soft, wide barrier history, poor recent form
- **Nails Murphy**: Only 1/8 on soft vs 3/14 on good - track concern
- **Sir Beveridge**: No soft track experience at all (0 starts), sharp class rise
