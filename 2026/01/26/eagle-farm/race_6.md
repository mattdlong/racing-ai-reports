# Eagle Farm R6 | 1400m BM78
Sun 26 Jan | 10:00am | 11r | Soft 5 | Rain

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #8 ASSENT @ $12.00 - 1.5u EW**

Path A (Value Overlay) + Path B (Place Specialist) qualified.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Tier | Action |
|---|-------|------|------|--------|------|------|--------|
| 8 | Assent | $12 | 12% | 37% | +44% | EW_VALUE | 1.5u EW |
| 6 | Carravilla | $4 | 22% | 61% | -12% | WATCH | - |
| 9 | Bengal Diamond | $4.40 | 18% | 48% | -21% | WATCH | - |
| 3 | Last Command | $3.40 | 20% | 45% | -32% | PASS | - |
| 10 | Vos Savant | $4.80 | 15% | 40% | -28% | PASS | - |
| 7 | Pierata's Gem | $3.70 | 14% | 35% | -48% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figure; Carravilla and Bengal Diamond show the most consistent recent times at similar distances.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Limited early speed suggests on-pacers will control; Carravilla (barrier 4) and Vos Savant (barrier 2) well-placed to stalk.

**Class**: Several runners rising in class. Assent (CL1 winner jumping to BM78) is the biggest class rise but has shown rapid improvement with consecutive wins. Carravilla won CL3 last start.

**Conditions**: Soft 5 track is critical. Assent (1 win from 4 soft), Bengal Diamond (4 wins from 13 soft - all 4 career wins on soft), Carravilla (1 win from 8 soft). Last Command (0/3 soft) and Treporti (0/8 soft) significantly compromised.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**#8 ASSENT** qualifies as EW VALUE via Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist). Coming off consecutive wins at Gatton (3.57L) and Beaudesert (0.91L), this 4yo gelding is progressive and meets all EW criteria: $12 odds (>$6), 56% EW EV (>5%), 37% place probability (>30%). Strong place specialist score of 2.85 (82% career place rate). The class rise is a query but rail barrier helps negate, and soft track form is adequate. At double-digit odds, the value is clear.

**Why not Carravilla?** Despite the hot form (1-1-3), the $4 odds create -12% edge. Not enough value despite being the likely danger.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Class jump**: Assent rising from CL1/BM65 to BM78 - significant step up in grade
2. **Metro inexperience**: First run at Eagle Farm; has raced provincially

## MARKET ANALYSIS

- Market %: 174% (soft market, inflated)
- Favorite: #3 Last Command @ $3.40 (implied 29%)
- Value detected: #8 Assent +44% overlay

## VERDICT

Weak BM78 on a Soft 5 track with rain. The market has latched onto Last Command ($3.40) who has poor wet form (0/3 soft) and is first-up at Eagle Farm after NSW campaign. **ASSENT** at $12 represents the standout value play - progressive galloper with perfect 2-from-2 record this prep, proven on soft ground, and a strong place specialist profile. The class rise is the query but the odds compensate generously.
