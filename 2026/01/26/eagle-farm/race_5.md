## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Super Freeze posted 55.76s at Townsville (Soft 1000m) last start - fastest sectional in field on wet track. Larado's 57.91s at Sunshine Coast comparatively slower.

**Pace**: CONTESTED - Multiple speed types (Bundella, Apollo Ten, Mr Playtime) will contest the lead. Benefits on-pace runners with tactical speed. Super Freeze has shown ability to stalk pace.

**Class**: Rising from BM65 (Townsville) to BM70 metro. Last two wins (BM65, Open Trial) show upward trajectory. 4 wins from 10 starts (40%) indicates quality.

**Bias**: Soft 5 with rain - wet track form critical. Super Freeze: 2/3 (67%) on Soft. Larado: 1/1 on Soft. Oohlalouvre: 0/6 on Soft (major concern). Bundella: 0/4 on Soft.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Super Freeze represents value at $6.50 each-way. Two consecutive wins including last start victory on Soft 5 at Townsville (1.7L margin) demonstrates current form and wet track ability. The 67% strike rate on soft tracks (2/3) is outstanding. Wide barrier (11) is the main negative but contested pace should negate some of that disadvantage. Place specialist score of 2.04 (60% place rate vs 29% expected) makes each-way particularly attractive. EW EV of +5.4% meets Path A criteria.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Wide barrier (11)** - Must overcome outside draw in 12-horse field
2. **First time Eagle Farm** - Unproven at the track (all wins provincial/country)
3. **Class rise** - Stepping from Townsville BM65 to Eagle Farm metro BM70

## MARKET WATCH

Larado ($2.20 favorite) looks short given wide barrier (12) and unproven at Eagle Farm. While 100% place rate is impressive, only 3 career starts makes sample size small. True odds closer to $3.50.

Oohlalouvre ($3.20) has terrible wet track form (0/6 on Soft) - strongly oppose on current surface.
