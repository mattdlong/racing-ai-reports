# Pakenham Race 1 - Hygain Edge Maiden Plate (2500m)
**Friday 16 January 2026 | 6:15 PM | Maiden | 6 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT

Slow tempo expected with likely uncontested lead. On-pacers and leaders strongly advantaged over this staying trip. **Phoenician** is the clear class runner but is **too short at $2.40** to offer value. This is a weak maiden staying race with no betting value identified.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Phoenician meets win probability threshold (35%) but fails edge requirement (-16% vs required +15%). Current odds of $2.40 are well below fair odds of $2.86.

---

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**NO EW VALUE** - No runners meet EW criteria. Small 6-horse field (only 2 places paid) limits place value. All contenders show negative EW EV with poor place specialist scores.

## FULL FIELD

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Grade | Summary |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 4 | Phoenician | 3 | $2.40 | 35% | 85% | -16% | B | Best chance but too short. 18 starts, 0 wins, 6 placings. Third-up, ran 2nd Echuca last start. Brad Rawiller aboard. |
| 2 | Diamond Flash One | 4 | $3.50 | 25% | 73% | -12% | B | Main danger. Consistent placegetter (0-2-0 from 7). Two seconds last two starts at Sale/Woolamai. |
| 1 | Devine Grunt | 1 | $7.00 | 12% | 36% | -16% | C | Inside draw helps. Third-up, ran 3rd Echuca. Limited ability but place chance. |
| 3 | Fear No One | 6 | $9.00 | 10% | 29% | -10% | C | Poor recent form (8th Colac). Did run 2nd two back. Needs improvement. |
| 6 | Grecia Girl | 2 | $10.00 | 10% | 28% | N/A | C | 3yo filly taking on older horses. Inside draw helps but 5th of 10 last start. |
| 5 | St Dominic | 5 | $15.00 | 8% | 22% | N/A | X | No placings from 8 starts. 4th Hanging Rock last. Others preferred. |

## KEY RISKS

1. **Phoenician heavily odds-on** - If he fails, race falls apart. Market confidence extreme.
2. **Weak field, slow pace** - Front-runners heavily advantaged; any horse leading has strong chance regardless of ability.

|-------|-----------|-------------|------|--------|
| Phoenician | $2.86 | $2.40 | -16% | No - Underlay |

| Devine Grunt | $8.33 | $7.00 | -16% | No - Underlay |
