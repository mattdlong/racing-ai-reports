# Pakenham Race 3 - Waterline Riding Academy Hcp (1000m)
**Friday 16 January 2026 | 8:15 PM | BM0-62 | 11 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Fast tempo expected with Cool Charlie and potentially Three Point Turn showing speed from inside draws. On-pace runners should be advantaged on a Good 4 track with 6m rail. Favourite Sideline is short but query resuming; place value exists at longer prices with proven place-getters.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Favourite Sideline (27% win prob) lacks edge at $3.65 (-1.4% underlay). No runner meets the combined 25% probability AND +15% edge threshold required. Market has priced top contenders accurately.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#1 COOL CHARLIE - E/W @ $22.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 24% |
| Place Odds | $6.40 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +69% |
| Specialist Score | 2.73 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Strong place specialist with 11 placings from 21 career starts (52%). Recent form of 1-2-3 in last three outings shows excellent consistency. Inside barrier (1) and proven at track give every chance to hit the frame at overs.

---

**#11 OVER THE STARS - E/W @ $46.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B/C]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 9% |
| Place Probability | 27% |
| Place Odds | $12.25 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +270% |
| Specialist Score | 2.32 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Another strong place specialist (8 placings from 16 starts = 50%) at massive overlay odds. Form figures of 3-2-4-2 show consistent placing ability. At these odds, only needs minor luck from wide draw.

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Grade | Summary |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Cool Charlie | 1 | $22.61 | 8% | 24% | +81% | B | Place specialist, 1-2-3 last 3, EW value |
| 2 | Three Point Turn | 2 | $19.28 | 6% | 18% | +15% | C | Lightly raced, each-way query |
| 4 | Sideline | 4 | $3.65 | 27% | 70% | -1% | A | Favourite, short but no overlay |
| 5 | Chartwell House | 5 | $45.48 | 3% | 10% | +36% | X | Poor recent form, dismiss |
| 6 | Regal Secret | 6 | $5.42 | 18% | 47% | -2% | B | Solid, but no value at price |
| 7 | Ruby Avenue | 7 | $15.35 | 7% | 20% | +8% | C | Minor claims, watching brief |
| 8 | Mission Gold | 8 | $10.04 | 10% | 28% | 0% | C | Fair price, place chance |
| 9 | No Overtaking | 9 | $9.59 | 8% | 22% | -15% | C | Short priced, prefer others |
| 10 | Latin Boss | 10 | $34.14 | 4% | 14% | +36% | X | Wide draw, needs luck |
| 11 | Over The Stars | 11 | $46.00 | 9% | 27% | +314% | B | Place specialist, huge overlay |
| 12 | Paradise Island | 12 | $5.41 | 12% | 31% | -35% | C | Too short, poor recent form |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Cool Charlie**: Wide field speed race may see him used early from barrier 1; if tempo is too hot, may tire late
2. **Over The Stars**: Widest draw (11) requires luck in running; relies on pace collapsing
