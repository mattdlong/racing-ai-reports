# Pakenham Race 7 - Pro Lift Garage Doors Hcp (1200m)
**Thursday 16 January 2026 | 10:15 AM | BM62 | 12 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Jakivy and Suppose I Do pressing from inside gates. Strong SE wind from the back straight favours on-pacers. Compressed market with four runners at $2.89-$3.10 offers no win value - all significant underlays. Place specialist angles provide the only opportunity.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the required criteria. Top market fancies (Jakivy, Suppose I Do, Lapland, Winmar) all show 22% or lower win probability against fair odds of $4.50+, yet trade at $2.89-$3.10. Edge ranges from -36% to -56%. Compressed market leaves no value on the win side.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#10 OLIVIA ROSE - E/W @ $9.77+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 30% |
| Place Odds | $3.19 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | -13% |
| Specialist Score | 4.46 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Career record of 6 placings from 8 starts (75% place rate) against expected 17% marks her as a strong place specialist. Wide barrier (11) is the concern, but consistent minor placings suggest she can find the frame even when not winning. Price compensates for draw.

**#3 RUSSIAN FRONT - E/W @ $13.70+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 5% |
| Place Probability | 22% |
| Place Odds | $4.17 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | -15% |
| Specialist Score | 4.19 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Career 11 placings from 25 starts (44% place rate) against expected 11% makes this a proven place specialist. Wide barrier (12) is problematic but recent form includes 2nd and 3rd placings. Longer price provides margin for the draw disadvantage.

| 13 | Lika Mosh | 10 | $101.00 | 1% | 5% | N/A | X | Outclassed |

## KEY RISKS

1. **Wide barriers**: Both EW selections (Olivia Rose bar 11, Russian Front bar 12) face significant draw disadvantages on a day with SE wind favouring on-pacers
2. **Compressed market**: Four runners at near-identical short prices suggests bookmakers see this as a lottery among the fancies - value seekers beware
