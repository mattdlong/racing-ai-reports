# Pakenham Race 5 - Ladbrokes Future Stars Series Heat 3 Mdn Plate (1400m)
**Thursday 16 January 2026 | 9:15 AM | Maiden | 10 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with no dominant leader - debutantes may contest early but lack race experience. On-pace runners from good barriers advantaged. Competitive maiden with three genuine chances but no standout Best Bet value at current odds. Small EW play available on well-bred debutante.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets qualification criteria. Silver Bullet closest at 24% win probability but edge only +0.8% (requires +15%). Market efficient on top three in betting.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#6 BUTTERSCOTCH - E/W @ $10.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 10% |
| Place Probability | 34% |
| Place Odds | $3.25 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +5.3% |
| Specialist Score | N/A (debut) |
| Stake | 1.0 unit E/W |

**Why EW**: Moody/Coleman debutante by The Autumn Sun from barrier 2. Trial form adequate (3rd Dec 23). First-time gear (lugging bit, nose roll) suggests stable has identified and addressed issues. Strong connections record with first-starters. At double-figure odds, place probability exceeds market expectations.

**Key Risk**: Untested at 1400m on race day; limited trial form compared to race-hardened rivals.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Market efficiency**: Top 3 all fairly priced or underlays - no Best Bet edge available
2. **Debutantes unknown**: Three first-starters add volatility; Butterscotch EW selection carries debut risk
3. **Wind factor**: Strong Southeasterly wind may affect horses racing wide on the course
