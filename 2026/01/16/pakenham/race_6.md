# Pakenham Race 6 - Ray White Pakenham & Officer (1400m)
**Friday 16 January 2026 | 9:45 AM | BM66 | 12 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Dollar Chaser (barrier 1) and Hola Amigos (barrier 2) likely to contest the lead. On-pacers and midfield runners advantaged. Competitive BM66 with no standout but strong each-way value identified in lightly-raced types with exceptional place records.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold. This is a competitive BM66 with the top four chances all assessed between 10-15% win probability. Market leadership is likely to be shared, and value exists at longer prices rather than backing a short-priced favourite.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#10 CURSE IT - E/W @ $12.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A+B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 10% |
| Place Probability | 31% |
| Place Odds | $3.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +18.1% |
| Specialist Score | 4.76 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Perfect 3/3 place record (1 win, 2 thirds) gives exceptional specialist score. Won debut at Geelong over 1760m showing stamina for 1400m. Greg Eurell trains well at Pakenham and the horse has trialled twice since April break. Path A (odds $12 + EW EV 18.1% + place prob 31%) and Path B (specialist score 4.76) both satisfied.

**#9 BAYOU MUSIC - E/W @ $8.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A+B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 14% |
| Place Probability | 37% |
| Place Odds | $2.75 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +7.4% |
| Specialist Score | 2.72 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Elite Freedman stable with 80% career place rate (4/5). Resumed with a second at Flemington Open 2 behind Arcora over 1800m on soft. Two trials since suggest fitness. Luke Currie booking adds weight. Path A (odds $8 + EW EV 7.4% + place prob 37%) and Path B (specialist score 2.72) both satisfied. Key risk is first-up at 1400m after racing over longer trips.

| 11 | All Business | 10 | $21.00 | 6% | 16% | +26% | C | Poor recent form, needs improvement |
| 5 | Southby | 9 | $26.00 | 4% | 11% | +4% | X | Limited form, resuming, wide barrier |

---

## KEY RISKS

1. **Resumers**: Both EW selections are resuming from breaks - fitness queries remain despite solid trial reports
2. **Barrier draws**: Main market fancies in middle-to-wide draws may contest for positions, creating scrimmaging
