# Pakenham Race 2 - NZB Karaka 2026 Maiden Plate (1600m)
**Friday 16 January 2026 | 7:45 AM | Maiden | 8 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT
Slow pace expected with limited early pressure - Miss Maranda likely to dictate from barrier 6. On-pacers strongly advantaged in small field. Market correctly identifies Miss Maranda as dominant but has overbet her, creating poor win value. Speculative EW play on place specialist at bigger odds only.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Miss Maranda has highest win probability (35%) but market odds ($1.73) offer -39% edge. No runner meets +15% edge threshold despite clear form superiority.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#3 TRANSPACIFIC - E/W @ $15.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 7% |
| Place Probability | 20% |
| Place Odds | $4.50 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | -2% |
| Specialist Score | 1.98 |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Qualifies via Path B (Place Specialist) with odds >= $8 and specialist score of 1.98. Has placed in 1 of 3 starts (33% place rate) despite minimal win ability. Second at Ballarat (1400m) shows she stays - stepping up to 1600m suits. Phillip Stokes runner with Ben Allen aboard. Expect to run on in a race that may set up for closers if pace collapses.

**Key Risk**: Genuine 7% winning chance means relying heavily on place component.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Miss Maranda dominance**: If she controls the race, others running for minors only
2. **Small field dynamics**: 8 runners means less value in place markets generally
