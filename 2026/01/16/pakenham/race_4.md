# Pakenham Race 4 - Ladbrokes Future Stars Series Heat 2 Mdn Plate (1200m)
**Friday 16 January 2026 | 8:45 AM | Maiden | 9 runners | Good 4**

## VERDICT

Moderate pace expected with Ten Warriors likely to settle handy from barrier 5. Rail out 6m entire circuit slightly disadvantages wide runners. Despite Ten Warriors' strong place record (7 placings from 10 starts), the $2.75 price offers no win value. Bradford presents genuine each-way value on second start after placing on debut.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - Ten Warriors meets 5 of 6 criteria (32% win prob, 4 stars confidence, zero red flags, 60% expert support) but fails edge threshold (-12% underlay at $2.75). Fair odds $3.12. No other runner meets the 25% win probability minimum.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#7 BRADFORD - E/W @ $12.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A + B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 10% |
| Place Probability | 34% |
| Place Odds | $3.77 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +24.6% |
| Place Specialist Score | 4.17 (STRONG) |
| Stake | 1.5 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Qualifies via Path A (odds $12+, EW EV +24.6%, place prob 34%) AND Path B (specialist score 4.17). Placed on debut 198 days ago, resuming with upside. Trainer combination Nichols/Black underrated. Luke Currie booking significant for maiden. Bar plates added.

**Key Risk**: Long 198-day break with no public trial - fitness query.

| 5 | Ten Warriors | 5 | $2.75 | 32% | 84% | -12% | A | Clear leader, 70% career place rate, but short odds |
| 3 | Louis Barthas | 2 | $4.78 | 18% | 48% | -14% | B | Blinkers on, 2nd/3rd recent, needs luck from B2 |

| 2 | I Said So | 3 | $11.85 | 8% | 23% | -5% | C | Inconsistent (5,2,8), tongue tie off query |
| 10 | Celtic Viva | 1 | $12.21 | 6% | 18% | +4% | C | Resuming 148d, poor debut prep (8th, 5th) |
| 1 | Blue Light Disco | 9 | $15.00* | 5% | 15% | - | C | Debut, Maher stable respect, wide barrier |
| 9 | Back Up Barbie | 6 | $25.39 | 4% | 12% | -2% | X | 2nd start, no debut improvement signs |
| 8 | Savoyard | 8 | $24.22 | 4% | 12% | +15% | X | Debut, no trial form to assess |

## KEY RISKS

1. **Bradford** long layoff (198 days) - fitness unknown, may need the run
2. **Ten Warriors** short-priced - any mishap means minimal return for place-only
