# Sunshine Coast Race 1 - Barrier Reef Pools Maiden Handicap (1000m)
**Friday 16 January 2026 | 7:38 AM | Maiden | 9 runners | Soft 6**

## VERDICT
Fast tempo expected with Dragon Link, Khoirgirl and Lira all showing early speed from favourable draws. On-pace runners favoured on the soft track.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#6 CERETTI - E/W @ $12.61+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 26% |
| Place Odds | $3.90 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +1.2% |
| Specialist Score | 3.47 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Placed 2 of 3 career starts (67% place rate) vs expected 19% at this win probability. Strong place specialist profile (3.47 score) qualifies via Path B. Third-up pattern, Gold Coast placing last start. Barrier 7 suits mid-race position.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Ceretti**: May not handle Soft 6 track - unproven on rain-affected going
2. **Race tempo**: If favourites dominate, speed-on runners may fill placings
