# Sunshine Coast Race 4 - Go Transit Media Group Class 4 Handicap (1400m)
**Friday 16 January 2026 | 7:08 PM | Class 4 Handicap | 10 runners | Soft 5**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with limited early speed in this small Class 4 field. On-pacers and mid-runners will be advantaged. No standout value identified - field lacks a dominant runner with sufficient edge or expert validation to warrant a Best Bet or Each-Way play.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold with +15% edge. Top contender Can't Getwhatiwant shows fair odds alignment but lacks the required edge (-1%) and expert consensus support.

---

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**NO EW VALUE** - Despite Scorch showing strong place specialist credentials (score 2.08), the expected win odds of $6.00 do not generate sufficient EW EV to qualify via Path A or B. Can't Getwhatiwant has marginal EW EV (+4.6%) but falls short of the +5% threshold for Path A qualification.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Limited data availability** - Unable to access live odds feeds; probability estimates based on form assessment only
2. **Soft track conditions** - Some runners may not handle the Soft 5 surface; watch for betting drift pre-race

---

## MARKET WATCH

- **Can't Getwhatiwant** (#2): If drifts to $5.50+ may present marginal value
- **Scorch** (#6): Strong place specialist - monitor for place-only opportunities if available
