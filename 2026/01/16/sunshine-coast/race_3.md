# Sunshine Coast Race 3 - Battery Wise Sunshine Coast Mdn Hcp (1200m)
**Friday 16 January 2026 | 8:38 AM | 3YO Maiden Handicap | 14 runners | Soft 6**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with a handful of potential leaders including Emphatique and Copper Star from inside gates. On-pace runners should be advantaged on the Soft 6 track. No standout Best Bet value exists with the favourite Emphatique a slight underlay, but two place specialists offer Each-Way interest.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets all criteria. Emphatique (favourite) has only 24% win probability (below 25% threshold), shows -4% edge at current odds, and lacks expert support data. Only 1 career start provides insufficient form evidence.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft 6 track**: Several debutants untested on rain-affected going - form lines unreliable
2. **Wide barriers**: Both EW selections draw outside half (barriers 5 & 10) which may compromise in small field
3. **Limited form**: Weak maiden with mostly first-starters and lightly-raced types - high variance race
