# Sunshine Coast Race 2 - Australian Energy Analytics (1000m)
**Friday 16 January | 8:08 AM | BM65 | 8 runners | Soft 6**

## VERDICT
Fast early tempo expected with multiple speed runners (Betty Maud, Provance, Bundella). On-pace types favoured but closers may benefit if they overdo it. Soft 6 track will test fitness late. Market appears to correctly assess main chances - no standout value for Best Bet designation.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets 25% win probability threshold. Top-rated Provance (22%) shows good recent form but market odds of $4.00 offer no edge (-12%). Open, competitive sprint lacking a clear standout.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#7 MAKE IT SO - E/W @ $9.00+** [EW VALUE - Path A]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 12% |
| Place Probability | 34% |
| Place Odds | $3.00 (1/4) |
| EW Total EV | +5.0% |
| Specialist Score | 1.84 (Strong) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Strong place specialist (53% career place rate vs 29% expected). Proven at Sunshine Coast, Liam Birchley stable in good form. Mid-pack runner who can capitalise if leaders overdo it in Soft 6 ground.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft 6 track** - Conditions may deteriorate further; fitness to be tested in ground
2. **Competitive field** - No clear leader; market correct on main chances being evenly matched
