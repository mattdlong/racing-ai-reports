# Sunshine Coast Race 6 - Perren & Penny Plumbing BM58 (1800m)
**Friday 16 January 2026 | 10:08 AM | Benchmark 58 | 13 runners | Soft 6**

## VERDICT
Moderate tempo expected with Whatjeudoin likely to control from barrier 1. The soft track suits the place-capable runners. This is a competitive benchmark race with no standout value - the market has it about right with Whatjeudoin the likely favourite but offering no edge at estimated odds.

---

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold. The top-rated Whatjeudoin (20% win prob) lacks sufficient edge at likely odds of $5.00, and expert consensus is fragmented across multiple contenders.

---

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**NO EW VALUE** - No runner qualifies via Path A, B, or C. While Makamae is a confirmed Place Specialist (score 1.32), the EW EV of +2.1% falls short of the +5% threshold required for Path A qualification. Sir Goldalot offers the best win edge (+12.5%) but place probability (35.5%) is marginal for EW consideration.

## KEY RISKS

1. **No clear value**: Market appears efficient with favourite Whatjeudoin priced near fair value
2. **Soft track variable**: Some runners untested on deteriorating ground - track may shift to Heavy
