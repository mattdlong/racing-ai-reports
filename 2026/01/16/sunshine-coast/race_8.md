# Sunshine Coast Race 8 - TAB Hcp (1000m)
**Friday 16 January 2026 | 9:08 PM | BM0-58 | 11 runners | Soft 6**

## VERDICT
Fast tempo expected with multiple speed runners (Itza Motza, Purosangue, Scriptus Vivace) likely to pressure from the gates over 1000m. This should suit runners with tactical speed who can find cover or those with strong finishing kicks. On the Soft 6, experience on rain-affected ground will be crucial. The short-priced favorite Miss Mercy presents no value at current odds.

## BEST BET

**NO BEST BET** - No runner meets the 25% win probability threshold with positive edge. Market leader Miss Mercy (est. 20% win prob) is trading below fair odds with zero expert tip confirmation available.

## EACH-WAY VALUE

**#9 POWERALONG - E/W @ $10.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 10% |
| Place Probability | 29% |
| Place Odds | $3.25 (1/4) |
| Specialist Score | 1.88 (STRONG) |
| Career Placings | 14/31 (45%) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Outstanding place specialist with 14 placings from 31 starts (45% strike rate). The expected place rate for a 10% win chance is just 24%, making Poweralong 1.88x more likely to place than probability suggests. Has placed at this track 3 times from 9 starts. Draw in barrier 5 suits to track the speed.

**#7 DASHING HOPE - E/W @ $12.00+** [EW VALUE - Path B]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Win Probability | 8% |
| Place Probability | 23% |
| Place Odds | $3.75 (1/4) |
| Specialist Score | 1.72 (STRONG) |
| Career Placings | 8/24 (33%) |
| Stake | 1.0 units E/W |

**Why EW**: Another proven place specialist with 8 placings from 24 starts. Best performer at this track with 1 win and 5 placings from 15 Sunshine Coast starts. The expected place rate is 19% but actual rate is 33% - consistently runs into the placings. Drawn wide (9) but should get cover from there.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Soft 6 track condition** - May deteriorate further with predicted rain; some runners unproven on wet tracks
2. **Fast pace scenario** - Multiple speed horses may create a genuinely run race that could disadvantage our place specialists if they get too far back
