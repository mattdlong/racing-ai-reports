## Race Overview

A 14-runner maiden over 6 furlongs on dirt at Jebel Ali. This is the "Daaeemm Incentive Stakes" which attracts a mix of lightly-raced 3-year-olds making their debuts and older horses still seeking their first win. The wide draw (14 stalls) on a tight track makes barrier position significant.

**Key Factors:**
- Dirt surface suits horses with American/local experience
- 6f sprint on a tight track - pace is crucial
- Wide draws (10+) are disadvantaged at Jebel Ali
- Trainer/jockey combinations matter in UAE racing

## Field Analysis

### KEY CONTENDERS

| No. | Draw | Horse | Age | Form | Jockey | Trainer | Analysis |
|-----|------|-------|-----|------|--------|---------|----------|
| 6 | 8 | **MASUBI** | 4 | 4/807- | Tadhg O'Shea | Bhupat Seemar | **TOP PICK** - Elite jockey/trainer combo. Form figures show placed effort (4th). Seemar/O'Shea fire at 25%+ in UAE. Mid-draw perfect. |
| 7 | 5 | **MNAWISH** | 4 | 4443- | Ray Dawson | Michael Costa | **DANGER** - Consistently placed (4th x3, 3rd). Best form in field. Low draw advantage. Costa having good season. |
| 14 | 6 | **YOUHEEB** | 3 | - | Silvestre De Sousa | Michael Costa | **DARK HORSE** - Debutant but has Silvestre De Sousa (top UAE jockey) booked. Costa 3yo maiden debutants perform. Weight allowance (8-10). |
| 9 | 14 | **PIPES AND DRUMS** | 5 | 66743- | Bernardo Pinheiro | Salem bin Ghadayer | Consistent form (3rd last time). But widest draw is a big negative. Would need luck in running. |
| 5 | 10 | **HOBALSALAM** | 5 | 40308- | Daniel Tudhope | Osama Refai | Tudhope rarely comes to UAE without live mounts. The 4th on debut promising but form has deteriorated. |

## Speed Map & Pace Analysis

```
LIKELY PACE SCENARIO: MODERATE-FAST

LEADERS (Rails → Wide):
├─ Yasup (1) - 3yo debutant, may show early
├─ Saleell (2) - Low draw, could be ridden forward
├─ Mnawish (5) - Has shown pace in runs
└─ Masubi (8) - Can track pace

MIDFIELD:
├─ Youheeb (6) - De Sousa likely settles mid
├─ Hobalsalam (10) - Tudhope tactically placed
└─ Pipes And Drums (14) - Needs to go forward or cover

BACKMARKERS:
├─ Wide draws (9-14) may drop back
└─ Inexperienced horses

PREDICTED SHAPE:
- Moderate early pace with 2-3 vying for lead
- Bunching expected into first turn
- Wide draws (12-14) in trouble unless ridden forward early
- 6f on dirt = staying power matters in final furlong
