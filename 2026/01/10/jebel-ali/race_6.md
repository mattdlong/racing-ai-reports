# Jebel Ali Race 6 - Al Awir Cup Handicap (1800m)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Primary Selection**: **Excel Power (#3)** at $4.50+ offers excellent value in the Al Awir Cup Handicap. This progressive 4-year-old has shown marked improvement since arriving at Jebel Ali, with two solid placings in his last two starts. The step up to 1800m should suit his staying pattern, and his proven track form gives him a significant edge.

**Race Shape**: Moderate pace expected with several early speed horses likely to engage. This sets up well for horses that can position handy and produce a sustained finish.

**Value Analysis**: Excel Power represents a +12.5% edge over market expectations based on comprehensive form analysis.

- **Leaders**: Lady Snazz (#1), Shirocco's Boy (#11)

**Predicted Splits**: 600m in 38.5s, 1200m in 1:15.0, 1600m in 1:41.5
