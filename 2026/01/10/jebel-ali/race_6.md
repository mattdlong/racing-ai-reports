# Jebel-Ali Race 6 - Al Awir Cup Handicap (1800m)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**TOP SELECTION: EXCEL POWER (#3)** - In superb current form with two recent placings at this track including a strong second just 14 days ago. The step up to 1800m looks ideal and Bernardo Pinheiro knows the horse well. At $4.50 represents solid value.

**DANGER: MAGIC PETITION (#1)** - Returns to a suitable level after tough assignments at Meydan. The extra 200m will suit and Connor Beasley's 10kg claim is valuable. Form reversal strongly expected.

**EACH-WAY: KIBO MISAKI (#7)** - Excellent track record (6: 1-4-1) and coming off a 56-day freshen-up. Has won third-up before and recent placings suggest ready to peak.

## RACE CONTEXT

- **Track & Conditions**: Firm dirt track at Jebel-Ali in fine weather
- **Distance**: 1800m - staying test for most of this field
- **Class**: HCP 0-80 level - suitable for most runners
- **Field Size**: 13 runners with wide spread of form levels
- **Prize Money**: Listed as $0.00 (likely display error)

## PACE ANALYSIS & SPEED MAP

**Early Leaders**: Moonshiner (#5), Hot Property (#8), Don Pelicano (#9)
**Midfield**: Excel Power (#3), Poster Paint (#6), Kibo Misaki (#7)
**Back Markers**: Magic Petition (#1), Goldspur (#4), Dubai Welcome (#11)

**Pace Projection**: Moderate pace expected with several runners likely to race prominently. The 1800m trip should allow for a strong finish.

## DETAILED RUNNER ANALYSIS

### EXCEL POWER (#3) - TOP SELECTION ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Jockey**: Bernardo Pinheiro | **Weight**: 61kg | **Odds**: $4.50

**Form Summary**: Outstanding recent form with 2nd at this track over 1950m (beaten 4.4L) and 3rd over 1600m (beaten 1.8L). Both runs in December show this horse is race-fit and competitive.

**Key Positives**:
- Excellent recent form with two placings at Jebel-Ali
- Well-suited to the 1800m distance (close to recent 1950m effort)
- Regular jockey Bernardo Pinheiro retains the ride
- Consistent performer with 19.5% win rate and 39% place rate

**Race Scenario**: Should settle in midfield and be strong late. The 1800m suits perfectly.

### MAGIC PETITION (#1) - DANGER ⭐⭐⭐
**Jockey**: Connor Beasley | **Weight**: 62kg | **Odds**: $6.00

**Form Summary**: Last two runs at Meydan in stronger company, but prior form at this level was competitive. The drop back to this grade and extra 200m in trip are positive factors.

**Key Positives**:
- Class relief from recent Meydan assignments
- Distance increase to 1800m should suit (was 4th over 1900m in November)
- Connor Beasley's booking is a positive
- 29-day freshen-up could help

**Concerns**: Recent Meydan form was disappointing but that was in tougher grade.

### KIBO MISAKI (#7) - EACH-WAY VALUE ⭐⭐⭐
**Jockey**: Q Al Busaidi | **Weight**: 59.5kg | **Odds**: $5.50

**Form Summary**: Excellent track specialist with outstanding Jebel-Ali record. Recent 3rd at 1950m and winner over this trip at this track in November.

**Key Positives**:
- Exceptional Jebel-Ali record: 6 starts for 1-4-1 
- Perfect distance record: 1800m 2: 1-1-0
- Third-up today and has won third-up previously
- 56-day freshen-up ideal preparation

**Race Scenario**: Can settle closer than usual and should be strong over final 400m.

### POSTER PAINT (#6) - EACH-WAY ⭐⭐
**Jockey**: T P O'Shea | **Weight**: 60kg | **Odds**: $8.00

**Form Summary**: Good second here in November over 1950m but last run at Meydan on turf was disappointing. Return to dirt and this track is positive.

**Key Positives**:
- Excellent second here over 1950m in November (beaten 3L)
- Distance suits with 1800m record: 6: 1-1-1
- Bhupat Seemar stable in good form

**Concerns**: Disappointing last start on turf but conditions are different here.

## OTHERS TO CONSIDER

**MOONSHINER (#5)**: Third-up and won third-up before but recent form modest. Could improve sharply.

**DON PELICANO (#9)**: Lightly raced 3yo with early career win. Each-way value if takes to the step up in trip.

**GOLDSPUR (#4)**: Course and distance winner but recent form poor. Hard to recommend.

## BETTING STRATEGY

### WIN BETS
- **Excel Power** - 2 units at $4.50+ (Best Bet)
- **Magic Petition** - 1 unit at $6.00+

### PLACE BETS  
- **Kibo Misaki** - 1.5 units at $2.20+

### EXOTIC COMBINATIONS
**Exacta**: 3-1, 1-3, 3-7, 7-3
**Trifecta**: 3-1-7, 1-3-7, 3-7-1 (50% each way)
**Quinella**: 1-3 ($20), 3-7 ($15)

## RISK FACTORS & WATCH POINTS

**Key Risks**:
- Track bias could favor leaders if pace is slow
- Some runners returning from spells or layoffs
- Weight differences could be significant over 1800m

**Market Watches**:
- Any significant drift in Excel Power's price would be concerning
- Support for Kibo Misaki could indicate stable confidence
- Watch for any late scratchings affecting pace scenario

**Weather Impact**: Firm track ideal - any rain would be negative for top selections.
