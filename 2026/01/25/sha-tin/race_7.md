# Sha Tin R7 | 1400m CL4
Sat 25 Jan | 6:35pm | 14r | Good

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Marginal value only; market efficiency high in HK racing

Best speculative play: #7 AEROINVINCIBLE @ $7.50 (0.2u) - marginal +5% edge

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 3 | All's Well | 3.80 | 55 | 22% | -16% | WATCH | - |
| 4 | Positive Smile | 5.00 | 52 | 18% | -10% | WATCH | - |
| 7 | Aeroinvincible | 7.50 | 48 | 14% | +5% | VALUE | 0.2% |
| 14 | Sterling Wongchoy | 9.50 | 45 | 11% | +5% | VALUE | 0.1% |
| 1 | Bigtime Generation | 8.00 | 42 | 10% | -20% | PASS | - |
| 12 | Smiling Falcon | 14.00 | 40 | 8% | +12% | WATCH | 0.3% |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: #4 Positive Smile has best recent figures (81.54s win 04/01), #3 All's Well stepping up from 1200m.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected; several on-pace runners but no genuine speed. Mid-runners advantaged.
**Class**: CL4 handicap; #4 Positive Smile off a win, rises in weights but proven at trip (7:2:2:0).
**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Good track suits majority.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

This is a competitive Class 4 with the market favouring **All's Well (#3)** at $3.80 off a solid C&D 4th last start and prior 1200m win. However, stepping up to 1400m first time is a query, and the price offers no value at -16% edge.

**Positive Smile (#4)** is the class runner off a dominant 1.3L win on 04/01 at this C&D. David Hayes yard in form, Keith Yeung retains ride. Wide barrier (13) is the concern in a big field. At $5.00 the edge is marginal (-10%).

**Aeroinvincible (#7)** offers slight value at $7.50 with +5% edge. Proven C&D performer (17:2:6), strong place consistency (29%). Andrea Atzeni booking is neutral. Drops back from 1650m which suits.

**Sterling Wongchoy (#14)** from barrier 1 with K Teetan aboard has upside. Form reads better than 5th suggests (beaten 0.5L in CL5). Rising in class is a query but inside draw helps.

## KEY RISKS

1. #3 All's Well untested at 1400m; market may be over-rating 1200m form
2. Wide barriers (13, 14, 12, 11, 10) disadvantaged if pace genuine
3. Hong Kong CL4 handicaps are fiercely competitive - any runner capable
