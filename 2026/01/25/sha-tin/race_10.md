| 8 | A Time For Us | 15.00 | 48.0 | 8% | +20.0% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Rising Force posted fastest recent time (68.96s) winning CL3 on 1 Jan; Mount Everest's 69.29s CL4 win competitive at weights.
**Pace**: CONTESTED shape with multiple early runners (Rising Force, Happy Index, Mount Everest) - suits stalkers/on-pace types.
**Class**: Class 2 rise for several - Rising Force comes off CL3 win (1.5L margin), Mount Everest promoted after CL4 win.
**Bias**: Neutral track bias, no rail advantage data available.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Mount Everest** (#9) represents the best value in this Class 2 sprint. The 4yo gelding has an excellent Sha Tin record (5:2-1-0) and proven at the 1200m trip (4:2-0-1). His last-start CL4 win (27 Dec) was accomplished from barrier 4 in 69.29s, defeating a 14-horse field by 0.3L. Rising to Class 2 is the logical step and the $7.50 price offers a +12.5% edge against assessed 15% win probability. The inside draw (barrier 4 today) suits his racing pattern.

**Rising Force** (#3) and **Happy Index** (#4) are the logical favourites but both are short enough to offer no edge. Rising Force's wide barrier 14 is a concern at Sha Tin 1200m where inside draws dominate. Happy Index has Zac Purton aboard but only 1 Sha Tin start and struggles on Good ground (0/6).

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise - first start at CL2 level
2. Contested tempo may burn off front-runners
