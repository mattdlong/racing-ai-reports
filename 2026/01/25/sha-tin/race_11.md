Sat 25 Jan | 8:50pm | 14r | Good

**STRONG_VALUE: #7 LOVERO @ $8.00 - 1.5u E/W**

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 7 | Lovero | 8.00 | 68.5 | 18% | +44% | STRONG_VALUE | 1.5% |

| 11 | Packing Fighter | 15.00 | 44.0 | 8% | +20% | WATCH | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Lovero produced a slick 94.63s winning last start at this track/distance, best recent figure in the field.
**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected with no confirmed leaders; mid-runners advantaged, suits Lovero's stalking style.
**Class**: Lovero drops back after CL3 win; Dazzling Fit competitive but shorter price doesn't offer value.
**Bias**: Track bias neutral (LOW confidence), no significant rail or style advantage detected.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Lovero (7) is the clear value play at $8.00. Won this race 3 weeks ago in fast time (94.63s), beating Dazzling Fit by nearly 2L. The market has them at $8 vs favorite Dazzling Fit at $3.80 despite Lovero's superior recent form. With 20 starts at the mile (4 wins) and course experience (8 starts, 1 win), the 6yo has proven credentials. Brett Crawford in form, Harry Bentley retains the ride after the win. The +44% edge and 29.7% EW EV make this a strong each-way proposition.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barrier (7) in 14-horse field may compromise position early
2. 21 days between runs - may need race fitness for sustained effort
