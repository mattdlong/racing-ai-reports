# Sha Tin R8 | 1600m Group 1 Stewards' Cup
Sat 25 Jan | 7:05pm | 9r | Good

## ACTION

**NO BET** - Market too efficient; favorite at $1.40 offers no value despite clear superiority

**WATCH: #2 VOYAGE BUBBLE @ $4.40** - Best value profile but marginal EW EV (+3.9%)

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Edge | Place% | Tier | Notes |
|---|-------|------|------|------|--------|------|-------|
| 1 | Romantic Warrior | 1.40 | 55% | -23% | 85% | PASS | Too short |
| 2 | Voyage Bubble | 4.40 | 22% | -3% | 60% | VALUE | Best EW option |
| 8 | My Wish | 8.00 | 12% | -4% | 36% | WATCH | Improving but outclassed |
| 6 | Galaxy Patch | 17.00 | 5% | -15% | 22% | PASS | Last-start G1 winner stepping up |
| 5 | Red Lion | 23.00 | 4% | -18% | 18% | PASS | Barrier 1 helps |
| 3 | Lucky Sweynesse | 41.00 | 2% | -20% | 10% | PASS | Sprinter stretching |
| 9 | Sunlight Power | 34.00 | 3% | -15% | 12% | PASS | Wide draw |
| 7 | Straight Arron | 51.00 | 2% | -20% | 8% | PASS | Outclassed |
| 4 | Beauty Joy | 61.00 | 1% | -25% | 6% | PASS | Aged, declining |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed/Class**: Romantic Warrior (21 wins/29 starts, 72% win rate) is clearly the class runner with G1 HK Mile/Cup/QE2 victories. Career place rate of 93% is exceptional.

**Pace**: Expect MODERATE tempo. Voyage Bubble and My Wish likely to settle midfield; Romantic Warrior typically races handy 3-4 wide.

**Distance**: Lucky Sweynesse (0 starts at 1600m) is stretching from 1200m sprints - significant query. Voyage Bubble (7 wins/15 starts at distance) is the proven miler behind the favorite.

**Conditions**: Rain forecast but track rated Good. Romantic Warrior has 19 wins from 26 Good track starts (73%). No concerns.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

This is a one-horse race on ratings. **Romantic Warrior** is the defending Stewards' Cup champion returning off dominant HK Cup (2000m, 1.8L) and HK Vase wins. At 8yo, he remains at peak - won barrier trial 13 Jan by 0.5L. James McDonald retains the ride.

However, at $1.40 (implied 71%), true probability ~55% means **-23% edge**. Cannot recommend betting at that price despite near-certain place.

**Voyage Bubble** offers the only semblance of value. Won HK Mile last start (Dec 14) by 0.5L, has 7 wins from 15 at 1600m, and Zac Purton rides. Place probability 60% vs $1.25 place odds (implied 80%) still shows underlay, but EW returns marginal +3.9% EV.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Romantic Warrior age** - 8yo, but no signs of decline (won 4 straight G1s)
2. **Voyage Bubble consistency** - Flopped 12th on Oct 19 at same course/distance before bouncing back
