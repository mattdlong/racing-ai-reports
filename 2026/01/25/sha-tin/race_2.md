## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Sea Sapphire has solid figures from consistent CL4 form; Lucky Eight best raw figure but regressing.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - Gallant Design and Dash likely to press, suits midfield runners like Sea Sapphire.
**Class**: Sea Sapphire rises from CL4 after running 2nd LTO; Lucky Eight has been competitive at CL3.
**Bias**: No significant bias detected (LOW confidence); barriers 1-6 slight advantage at Sha Tin 1200m.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Sea Sapphire ran a strong 2nd at Sha Tin over 1200m on Jan 1, beaten just a nose in CL4 (70.17s). The 6yo gelding has proven C/D form (2 wins from 14 starts at Sha Tin, 2 wins from 22 at 1200m) and draws barrier 4 - ideal to slot in midfield. Market shows $5.50 vs fair odds of $5.00, giving a genuine 10% edge. The rise to CL3 is manageable given his competitive record against similar horses. Maxime Guyon rides, providing a reliable pilot.

## KEY RISKS

1. Class rise from CL4 to CL3 - first start at this level
2. Rain forecast may affect track; Sea Sapphire's sole soft track run was poor (12th)
