# Sha Tin R5 | 1400m CL3
Sat 25 Jan | 5:30pm | 14r | Good

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #9 TOP PEAK @ $12 - 1.5u E/W**
**EW VALUE: #14 FIGHT TIME @ $16 - 1u E/W**

Win market lacks value - all favorites underlay. EW approach recommended.

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | EW EV |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 7 | Super Dragon | 3.70 | 58 | 22% | -19% | WATCH | - |
| 3 | Gallant Epoch | 4.40 | 62 | 20% | -12% | WATCH | - |
| 5 | Turin Champions | 4.80 | 48 | 14% | -33% | PASS | - |
| 2 | Monarch County | 9.00 | 45 | 9% | -19% | PASS | - |
| 9 | Top Peak | 12.00 | 52 | 8% | -4% | VALUE | +14% |
| 14 | Fight Time | 16.00 | 48 | 6% | -4% | VALUE | +31% |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Gallant Epoch posts best recent figures (81.36s win 3 weeks ago), Super Dragon lacks race wins despite strong trials.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no dominant leaders, mid-field runners should get favorable run with potential for late closers.

**Class**: CL3 Handicap - Gallant Epoch rising after CL4 win, Fight Time dropping from CL4 struggles, Top Peak solid CL4 form.

**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence) - no rail position data, rain forecast may assist wet-track performers.

## FIELD ASSESSMENT

| # | Horse | Bar | Odds | Form | C/D | Place% | Notes |
|---|-------|-----|------|------|-----|--------|-------|
| 1 | Eternal Richness | 5 | 31 | 7x21 | 0/3 | 40% | First 1400m, limited form |
| 2 | Monarch County | 10 | 9 | 2977 | 1/7 | 36% | Wide draw, inconsistent |
| 3 | Gallant Epoch | 6 | 4.4 | 1232 | 2/9 | 47% | Last start winner, class rise |
| 4 | Holmes A Court | 3 | 21 | 5xxx | 0/0 | 27% | No distance form |
| 5 | Turin Champions | 14 | 4.8 | 2266 | 0/1 | 67% | Widest draw, short priced |
| 6 | Jolly Brilliant | 12 | 26 | 8x11 | 0/1 | 0% | Limited starts, wide gate |
| 7 | Super Dragon | 7 | 3.7 | 6228 | 0/1 | 33% | Fav, yet to win, trials OK |
| 8 | Derrynblue | 4 | 41 | xx13 | 0/1 | 0% | Very limited, can ignore |
| 9 | Top Peak | 13 | 12 | 5252 | 2/14 | 35% | C/D specialist, place form |

| 11 | Lucky Mcqueen | 1 | 10 | 8228 | 0/0 | 25% | Rail draw, no distance form |
| 12 | Golden Luck | 2 | 15 | 4526 | 0/3 | 26% | Good draw, limited at track |
| 13 | Tai Victory | 11 | 51 | 9xxx | 0/0 | 10% | Out of form, can ignore |

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Top Peak** (#9) is a proven 1400m specialist at Sha Tin with 2 wins and 7 places from 14 starts at the C/D. His recent form reads 5-2-5-2 showing consistent placings. Place specialist score of 2.68 (STRONG) combined with $12 odds yields +13.6% EW EV. Wide barrier a concern but experienced campaigner handles it.

**Fight Time** (#14) has outstanding place record (9 from 23 starts = 39%) despite just one win. True place specialist score of 3.41 (STRONG) makes him an EW play at $16. Won at this C/D in September and placed twice since. EW EV of +31% is the best value in the race.

## KEY RISKS

1. Wide barriers for both EW selections (13 and 8) in 14-runner field
2. Super Dragon or Gallant Epoch may dominate if race tempo suits
3. Rain forecast - limited wet track data on selections

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

- Market 132% overbroke - significant value extraction opportunity
- Super Dragon ($3.70) likely cop money despite 0 wins from 3 starts
- Gallant Epoch ($4.40) fair price for last start winner rising in class
- Turin Champions ($4.80) way too short from barrier 14
