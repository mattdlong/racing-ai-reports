# Pinjarra Scarpside R4 | 1200m Maiden

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Score | Win% | Edge | Tier | Kelly |
|---|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| 9 | Can't Catch Me | $2.20 | 46.2 | 35% | -23% | VALUE | - |
| 8 | Youanmi | $4.60 | 30.3 | 12% | -45% | WATCH | - |
| 3 | Desert Waves | $5.50 | 28.4 | 14% | -23% | PASS | - |
| 7 | God's Cross | $6.00 | 27.0 | 10% | -40% | PASS | - |
| 6 | El Alamein | $14.00 | 25.5 | 8% | +12% | PASS | - |
| 10 | Diamond Choux | $23.00 | 22.0 | 5% | -15% | PASS | - |

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No reliable speed figures - weak maiden field with inconsistent form lines. Can't Catch Me showed 71.66s last start (2nd) which is the benchmark.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. Can't Catch Me and Desert Waves likely to press early from good draws (barriers 6 and 1). Shape should suit on-pace runners.

**Class**: Provincial maiden with $873 prize - bottom tier. All runners winless with limited exposed form. Career starts range from 0-8 with no wins across the field.

**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**NO BET RECOMMENDED.** Can't Catch Me (9) is the logical horse - second at this track/distance 10 days ago (beaten 0.22L), ran second in trial before that. However, $2.20 offers no value against my 35% assessed probability (fair odds $2.86). The 23% negative edge makes this an underlay.

Each-way alternatives lack appeal: Desert Waves (3) returning from 451-day spell with only 2 career starts; Youanmi (8) showed promise finishing 5th here last start but $4.60 is too short; God's Cross (7) has worst barrier (12) in a 12-runner field.

## KEY RISKS

1. Favorite overlaid by 23% - market too confident in Can't Catch Me
2. Weak maiden form makes probability estimates unreliable
3. Multiple first-up/lightly-raced runners create volatility

## CONTENDER NOTES

**#9 Can't Catch Me** - Market leader with best recent form (2nd here 10 days ago, beaten 0.22L). 4yo mare with favorable barrier (6). David Harrison/Brad Parnham combination. However, $2.20 offers insufficient value.

**#8 Youanmi** - Ran 5th in same race as Can't Catch Me last start. Trial winner prior. Nice barrier (5) but needs improvement to threaten. Lisa Staples retains ride.

**#3 Desert Waves** - Best draw (barrier 1) but concerning 451-day absence. Won trial in Jan 2024 but only 2 official starts. Risk/reward unfavorable at $5.50.

**#7 God's Cross** - Ran 4th at Bunbury first-up over 1000m. Steps up in distance. Worst barrier (12) is significant negative in 12-runner maiden.
