## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Bundaberg has the best recent form with 3rd in CL3 at Bunbury (64.67s/1100m), indicating fitness edge over this field. Universal Hotness consistent but modest figures from higher class races.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Bundaberg from barrier 1 should secure a forward position. Tassort We Want (bar 2) may press. Queen Aria and Global Trip likely to settle midfield.

**Class**: Standard provincial CL1 (prize $4,752). Bundaberg tested at CL3 level. Universal Hotness dropped from CL5. Champagne Crusader untested at this level on good ground.

**Bias**: Neutral bias reported (LOW confidence). Small field negates barrier concerns. Inside draws (1-3) marginally preferred.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#7 BUNDABERG** ($2.25) - 3yo gelding with 1 win from 8 starts (13%). Rail draw ideal for on-pace pattern. Won maiden at 1200m Pinjarra (soft). Concern: Only 1 placing from 4 good track runs (0-0-1). Soft track specialist profile doesn't fit today's Good 4. Score: 51.7/100.

**#3 UNIVERSAL HOTNESS** ($3.90) - 5yo with exceptional place consistency (53% place rate, 11 places from 19 starts). Dropping from CL5 class. Lacks a recent win (1 from 19). Place EV +15.6% makes for place-only interest, but odds too short for recommendation. Score: 41.7/100.

**#5 QUEEN ARIA** ($4.80) - 4yo mare with recent form upswing (2nd Bunbury CL1, 0.23L margin). Has course experience (2 Pinjarra runs). Wide barrier 7 a concern in small field. Place specialist profile (63% place rate). Score: ~40/100.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Bundaberg** - Good track form poor (0-0-1 from 4), all wins/places on soft. Today's Good 4 may not suit.
2. **Champagne Crusader** - 141 days off with only 1 good track start in career. Trial form unimpressive.
3. **Hope To Rule** - Longest layoff (192 days). Recent trials weak (8th, 9th). Jockey booking (S Parnham) only positive.

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market well-formed at 126.2%. Bundaberg correctly installed as favorite based on class and fitness edge, but $2.25 offers no value against soft-track profile. Universal Hotness at $3.90 represents fair odds. Roughies (Global Trip $12, Tassort We Want $20, Hope To Rule $19) offer mathematical value but come with significant risk flags.
