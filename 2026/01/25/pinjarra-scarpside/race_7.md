## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Vatican Storm posted best recent figures (70.18s for 1200m), but stepping up in trip. Cantrix won at Pinjarra 3 weeks ago in 77.97s for 1300m - progressive type.

**Pace**: MODERATE tempo expected. Vatican Storm likely to press, Cantrix can sit handy from barrier 4. Surf Patrol (barrier 9) needs cover but has tactical speed.

**Class**: BM56 provincial grade. Vatican Storm rising sharply from 3YO maiden company. Cantrix won CL1 last start - class appropriate. Surf Patrol placed in CL3/CL5 - fits well.

**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence - rail position unknown. Good 4 surface suits most runners.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**CANTRIX** (70.6 score, +62% edge) is the clear value play. The Jamie Morgan-trained mare has outstanding form: 2 wins from 5 starts (40% strike rate) with 4 placings (80% ITM). Won at this track 3 weeks ago over 1300m, now stepping to 1400m which suits her closing style. At $9.00, the market significantly underrates her chances given the progressive profile and course-winning form. The favorite Vatican Storm is untested beyond 1200m and faces a significant class rise - his $1.65 represents poor value despite obvious talent.

**SURF PATROL** qualifies as a Place Specialist (score 3.2) with 62% career place rate. At $11.00 each-way, the place odds of $2.63 offer value given his consistent placings record.

## KEY RISKS

1. Vatican Storm may have superior class - only 3 career starts with plenty of upside
2. Cantrix has never raced beyond 1300m (untested at 1400m)
3. Rain forecast may affect track - both selections prefer Good ground
