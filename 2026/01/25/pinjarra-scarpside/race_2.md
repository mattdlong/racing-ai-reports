# Pinjarra-Scarpside R2 | 1200m 3YO MDN
Sat 25 Jan | 4:58pm | 8r | Good 4

## ACTION

**NO BET - Short-priced favorite offers no value; debutant is speculative**

The favorite Just Walter John ($1.70) has excellent place form but is too short given maiden status. Cocobelle ($5.00) shows strong trial form but is an unknown on race day. This is a WATCH race.

## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Limited time data available; Cocobelle's trial time of 56.92s at Lark Hill 950m is sharp.
**Pace**: MODERATE expected - no confirmed leaders; Just Walter John has on-pace style.
**Class**: Provincial 3YO maiden; low prizemoney ($7,495) indicates weaker grade.
**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence); no track data advantage identifiable.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#1 JUST WALTER JOHN** ($1.70 Fav)
- 4 starts: 0-0-4 (100% place rate) - consistent but yet to break through
- Last run: 2nd Ascot 1000m (beaten 1.2L) - shortened from 1200m today
- Trial win: Belmont 1000m by 5.45L (impressive)
- Positives: Barrier 3, P. Carbery up, peak fitness (11 days)
- Negatives: Yet to win at 1200m, tight price for a maiden

**#8 COCOBELLE** ($5.00)
- DEBUT - 0 official starts
- Trial form: Won last 2 trials - Lark Hill 950m (56.92s, +0.96L), Belmont 1000m (+0.14L)
- Trainer: Darren Taylor
- Positives: Improving trial form, good barrier (4), fresh
- Negatives: First race start, unknown under pressure, no race experience

**#2 HELLBENT FOR GLORY** ($4.00)
- 2 starts: 0-0-1 (50% place rate)
- Last run: 3rd here at Pinjarra Scarpside 1200m (C/D) - beaten 1.57L
- Course experience is valuable; inside barrier (1) suits
- Needs to find improvement to beat favorite

## SELECTION RATIONALE

This is a difficult race for betting. The favorite Just Walter John has placed in all 4 starts but hasn't broken through, and $1.70 offers no value for a maiden. The debutant Cocobelle has won two trials impressively and represents the main value play at $5.00, but first starters are inherently risky. Hellbent For Glory has C/D form but appears held on ratings.

**RECOMMENDATION**: WATCH - If wanting a speculative bet, Cocobelle each-way at $5.00+ offers the best risk/reward profile given strong trial form, but confidence is limited for a debutant.

## KEY RISKS

1. Just Walter John may finally break through at short odds - genuine class of field
2. Cocobelle is untested in race conditions - trial form doesn't always translate
3. Limited form depth on most runners makes assessment uncertain
