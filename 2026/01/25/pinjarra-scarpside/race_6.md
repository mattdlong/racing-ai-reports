# Pinjarra Scarpside R6 | 1500m CL1
Sat 25 Jan | 7:25pm | 12r | Good 4

## ACTION

**EW VALUE: #7 SYLVA JACK @ $15.00 - 1.5u E/W**

Place odds: $3.60 | Place prob: 30% | EW EV: +27.5%

## EDGE TABLE

| # | Horse | Odds | Win% | Place% | Edge | Tier | Notes |
|---|-------|------|------|--------|------|------|-------|
| 8 | Common Touch | 3.40 | 22% | 52% | -22% | WATCH | Fav, consistent placer |
| 3 | You Can Call Me Al | 3.90 | 20% | 47% | -22% | WATCH | Rail draw, 50% place rate |
| 9 | The Rocket | 5.50 | 14% | 34% | -23% | WATCH | Good barrier, improving |
| 5 | Bradbury's Moment | 6.50 | 12% | 29% | -22% | PASS | Wide barrier (13) |
| 7 | Sylva Jack | 15.00 | 8% | 30% | +20% EW | **EW VALUE** | Place specialist 4.56 |
| 12 | Heavenly Rapture | 11.00 | 7% | 24% | -12% | PASS | Wide barrier (12) |

## ANALYSIS

**Form**: Common Touch (8) and You Can Call Me Al (3) are the obvious dangers with consistent recent form. Common Touch 3rd last start at this track over 1600m. You Can Call Me Al 2nd last two, drops slightly in class.

**Pace**: MODERATE expected. No obvious leaders; likely midfield bunch with The Rocket (9) and Common Touch (8) likely to settle handy from good draws. Shape suits on-pace runners.

**Class**: CL1 level, weak provincial race. Most runners are exposed maidens stepping up after recent placings. Field quality is modest.

**Bias**: No significant track bias detected (LOW confidence). Rail position not specified.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**Sylva Jack (7)** qualifies as EW VALUE via all three paths:
- **Path A** (Value Overlay): $15 >= $6, EW EV +27.5% >= +5%, Place prob 30% >= 30%
- **Path B** (Place Specialist): $15 >= $8, Specialist score 4.56 >= 1.3
- **Path C** (Longshot Place): $15 >= $15, Place prob 30% >= 25%, Place EV +35% >= +10%

Career: 3 starts for 0-2-0 (67% place rate). Last start 2nd at Bunbury 1400m maiden, beaten 0.5L. Step up to 1500m suits breeding (by Sylvano). Apprentice Holly Nottle claims 2kg. Wide barrier (14) is the main concern but place odds of $3.60 offer value against 30% place probability.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Wide barrier (14)**: Will need luck from gate, though moderate pace may help
2. **First time 1500m**: Untested at this trip, though breeding suggests it suits
3. **Small sample size**: Only 3 career starts limits confidence

## MARKET WATCH

- **Common Touch (8)** $3.40: Deserved favourite, consistent, but short
- **You Can Call Me Al (3)** $3.90: Rail draw, 50% place rate, danger
- **The Rocket (9)** $5.50: Good draw (3), improving 3yo, watch for support

## NO BEST BET

No runners meet Best Bet criteria. Favourites lack edge at current prices. Market is efficient on the top end.
