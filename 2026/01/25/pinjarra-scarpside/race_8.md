## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Magical Sequence has the best recent form (3 wins from 7 starts, 43% SR) with back-to-back wins at this track. Don't Trust Judas won last start at Pinjarra over 1406m.

**Pace**: MODERATE shape expected. Big Shots (bar 1) and Don't Trust Judas (bar 2) likely to set the pace from inside draws. Suits on-pace runners and stalkers.

**Class**: BM60 country level. Magical Sequence rising from CL3 win, progressive mare. So Nataya dropping from metro class (won CL3 at Ascot May '25).

**Bias**: Neutral bias detected (LOW confidence). No significant style or barrier advantage.

## SELECTION RATIONALE

**So Nataya** represents strong each-way value at $9.50. The 5yo mare has a 27% win rate (4/15) and 53% place rate with proven form at 1400m (1 win from 5 starts). Her last win was a CL3 at Ascot over 1400m in May '25. While returning from a spell with a moderate first-up run (9th at Ascot 1200m), she gets the ideal barrier (4), class relief dropping to BM60, and the distance she relishes. Place specialist score of 1.58 indicates strong place value. Qualifies via both Path A (Value Overlay) and Path B (Place Specialist).

**Magical Sequence** is the likely favourite and deserves respect as the most progressive runner. The 4yo mare has won 3 of 7 (43%) with 5 placings (71% ITM). She's 2-from-3 at this track and comes off a last-start CL3 win here over 1300m. However, at $3.10 there's no edge (-0.8%) as the market has priced her appropriately. Rising in distance to 1400m for the first time is a query.

## KEY RISKS

1. So Nataya returning from 4+ months spell - freshness uncertain
2. Magical Sequence untested at 1400m - could find the trip easy or difficult
