## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: No standout speed figures in this weak CL1 field. All runners are maidens or lightly raced with no wins from combined 117 career starts.

**Pace**: SLOW expected. No confirmed leaders, staying trip should suit backmarkers. She's Resolute and Danea Rock likely to settle midfield.

**Class**: CL1 provincial - weak form lines. Recent placings only indicator of ability.

**Bias**: Neutral bias (LOW confidence). Rail draw may offer slight advantage in small field.

## RUNNER NOTES

**#1 Declared Innocent** ($2.40 FAV)
- 0/25 career (6 places, 24% place rate)
- Best form: 2nd Pinjarra 2000m, 3rd Northam 2200m
- Wide barrier (9) in small field
- Trainer John Popescu, jockey Austin Galati
- **Assessment**: Best recent form but overbet at $2.40. Fair odds $3.12.

**#6 She's Resolute** ($4.20)
- 0/18 career (4 places, 22% place rate)
- Best form: 2nd Bunbury 2238m (LT), 3rd Bunbury 2000m
- Good barrier (3), distance suited
- Trainer Brendon Fitzgerald, jockey Jefferson Tsang
- **Assessment**: Closest to value. Strong recent placings at staying trips.

**#7 Danea Rock** ($3.00)
- 0/23 career (2 places, 9% place rate)
- Best form: 3rd Bunbury 2238m (same race as She's Resolute)
- Inside barrier (1), jockey Brad Parnham (best rider)
- **Assessment**: Overbet based on jockey booking. She's Resolute beat her by a length last start.

## EACH-WAY ANALYSIS

| Horse | Win EV | Place EV | EW EV | Rating |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| #1 Declared Innocent | -23.2% | +14.8% | -4.2% | NO VALUE |
| #6 She's Resolute | -7.6% | +14.8% | +3.6% | MARGINAL |
| #7 Danea Rock | -46.0% | -23.0% | -34.5% | NO VALUE |

She's Resolute shows marginal EW value but insufficient edge for a bet.

## KEY RISKS

1. **Weak field** - All maidens, form unreliable
2. **Weather** - Rain may change track conditions
3. **Wide barrier #1** - Declared Innocent from gate 9

## VERDICT

This is a weak CL1 maiden staying race with no proven winners from 117 combined career starts. The favorite (#1 Declared Innocent) is the most consistent placer but is overbet at $2.40 (fair odds $3.12).

#6 She's Resolute offers the closest approach to value at $4.20 with recent staying form (2nd, 3rd at 2000m+) and shows marginal EW value (+3.6%), but the edge is insufficient to recommend a bet.

#7 Danea Rock is heavily overbet at $3.00 (fair odds $5.56) likely due to jockey Brad Parnham booking.

**Recommendation**: PASS - No value. If forced to watch, She's Resolute for place at $1.33.
