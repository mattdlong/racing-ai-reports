## ANALYSIS

**Speed**: Bosun posted fastest Pinjarra 1200m time (70.32s) in last start, 2L clear of this field on figures.

**Pace**: MODERATE scenario expected - no genuine leaders identified. Bosun and Media Mogul both rated mid-pack runners who can position 3-4 wide with cover.

**Class**: Bosun has metro trial form (2nd at Ascot), significantly stronger than this country maiden field. Media Mogul's trial win (Lark Hill) gives confidence but softer.

**Bias**: Track bias data LOW confidence - assume neutral. No significant barrier or style advantage detected.

## CONTENDER PROFILES

**#3 BOSUN** ($2.00) - Patrick Carbery / Mitchell Pateman
- Career: 2 starts, 0 wins, 2 places (100% place rate)
- Last: 2nd Pinjarra 1200m (beaten 0.03L) - close runner-up
- Prior: 3rd Ascot 1200m - metro trial form franked
- Green lights: Metro class, 100% consistency, improving
- Assessment: Clear top pick but fairly priced

**#6 MEDIA MOGUL** ($2.25) - Holly Nottle (A2) / Darren McAuliffe
- Career: 3 starts, 0 wins, 1 place
- Last: 3rd Bunbury 1000m (beaten 0.7L)
- Won Lark Hill trial impressively (2.64L margin)
- Red flags: Stepping up 200m, A2 claim
- Assessment: Danger but no value

**#11 ZALI'S GIFT** ($6.50) - Lucy Fiore / Brandon Fiore
- Career: 8 starts, 0 wins, 3 places (38%)
- Last: 3rd Ascot 1400m - back in trip suits
- Consistent placer but lacks winning ability
- Assessment: Place chance only

## SELECTION RATIONALE

Bosun is the deserved favourite with superior form credentials - 100% place rate from two starts including a nose second at this track/distance. The close-up 3rd at Ascot represents the class benchmark of this field. However, at $2.00 (implied 50%) vs my assessed 38% true probability, there is no betting value. The market has priced in the obvious form advantage.

Media Mogul at $2.25 represents worse value despite being a legitimate danger - his trial form is impressive but lacks race-day confirmation.

## KEY RISKS

1. Bosun has not won - may find another one to beat
2. 22-day spacing is optimal but first time at Scarpside track
3. Wide barrier (7 of 12) in moderate tempo could see him caught three-wide

## MARKET ASSESSMENT

Market percentage: 130% (standard country book)
Favourite: #3 Bosun at $2.00 (50% implied)
Value threshold: Bosun would need $2.60+ for positive edge
